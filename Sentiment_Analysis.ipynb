things there was very pricey      read more   read less i really liked this hotel and will probably book there again  amenities are awesome  overall hotel is very nice  the reason i reviewed as i did was because when we arrived  the hotel staff told us that they overbooked and we were going to have to be moved from room to room in the middle of our stay  with children  that sucks  but we didn t have a choice  we booked so long in advance there was no way another hotel would be the same price and the area was pretty sold out  so we bit the bullet  but the next morning we went downstairs and the staff at the counter had no idea what we were talking about  then informed us that there were no other rooms to move us to  which is great  it was just an inconvenience we had to stay packed for a day thinking we d be moving rooms and then when addressed no one knew what we were talking about  also  breakfast at the summit restaurant in the same parking lot  we got the continental and it was just fruit and a fruit pastry  i paid for a different breakfast but it was ridiculously priced  if we weren t staying at the hotel  two bowls of fruit  two pastries  two plates of biscuits and gravy would have been        luckily it was not that much since we were staying there  so  other than that miscommunication at the front  the hotel was one of the nicer ones we ve ever stayed in with our

very clean and some of the staff members were rude  i will def look for other resort options in the future       read more   read less i stayed here with my girlfriend for her birthday  prior to my stay i messaged the hotel about any additions for the birthday that if they added i would pay for in advance and appreciate  none of that happened  upon check in the front desk woman was coarse and seemed overworked  i had questions about the amenities and she quickly averted the topic  the bartenders in the lobby were nice but it seemed that everyone was from another country that s all they talked about   that s fine with me but it became noticably worse when they were arriving to work visibly hung over      the  resort  is fine  at check in we were handed a map that let us know where everything was  there was a quiet pool on that map that we were looking forward to  however the reality is that it was unmonitored and often over run by kids and louder adults  the same with the hot tub  there is no spa here despite what is advertised  there is a small gym open to anyone and a sauna   and during our stay there were kids everywhere so we didn t bother to use these features  also   there are ducks on the property  for me and my girl we enjoyed them and know that in florida wildlife comes with staying anywhere  however it was really disheartening to see kids and young adults violently chasing them away at times  it the hotel can staff some outdoor attendants to inform and assist with how the resort should run  our stay would have probably been a lot better      read more

our bill for one plated meal was            the bus transport they offer to the parks is ridiculous and the drivers are rude even to children  and they are always late  they also leave when people are walking running up flagging them down to wait   saw this on multiple occasions during our three day stay    nothing in this hotel is disney themed other than the  store  down stairs  oh  and the fees to stay here are outrageous      a night resort fee  but you also have to pay     a day to park your car  even if you park it  so for three nights  we had to pay      in resort fees and     to park

we were only comfortable   of the   nights we stayed in this hotel  i rented two rooms  both were changed day   due to cold showers the prior two nights  then the hot water in the entire hotel went out and they lied for several hours before it was fixed instructing is to run the water for    minutes  just   more minutes   until i went to the desk and they finally said the repair had just begun  another cold shower  and left in the morning  when we returned  the bed had water on it dripping from the air conditioner vent and the ac was not working correctly  since it couldn t be fixed  all furniture was moved to the side out of the drip area which meant i couldn t sit on the bed without hitting my head on a light  and no ac for that evening  the next day they lied again saying it had been fixed  i had to call for them to move the furniture back and then looked up to see more water on the vent  we pushed the furniture over ourselves and slept like that the rest of our stay  without the ac working properly  after talking to every single manager and getting nowhere i had to wait two hours one morning day   to speak to the director of operations who all but accused me of lying because why would he  take a customers word over his employees   he took   days off of one of my rooms  my second room that had been changed the same day as the first smelled like rotten eggs the

staying here several times during the past six years  this was likely our final stay  the location is excellent  it s about a five minute walk to disney springs  the pool is great and has a section that s wonderful for kids  the food at the pool  although a little pricey  is pretty good  both the park shuttles and beds were great     however  the last two times we have stayed the housekeeping has been less than ideal  i gave them the benefit of the doubt last time and thought maybe we had the same housekeeper every time and they were just having some bad days but it happened this trip too  the tile floors were not cleaned during our stay and we had two people with long hair  the tub did not seem to get cleaned because a rusty stain started appearing from the dripping however i think they did try because two days when we came back for the evening  the tub was plugged and water was standing in it  we had the garden view on our other trips and this time we were stuck in the back by the employee parking  we missed the view but thought maybe it would be quieter since less people were walking past  etc  but the car alarms all night made up for it  the hotel room wasn t showing too much wear other than the tub definitely needed to be refinished as there were several peeling spots     i have recommended this hotel to many people due to our previous experiences however this trip was disappointing and for a small amount more  next time will stay on property       read more   read less very close to the parks  excellent room service  the food was delicious  we had a great time

deborah and ali at tesoro cove who brought her out a cupcake and sang happy birthday to her   she really loved it and nothing really phases her  not even the surprise trip           i feel like there should have been a shuttle bus to universal studios from the resort as well as to disney  the shuttle buses eliminate the costly expense of parking        i ordered room service two of the nights that we stayed and i was under the impression the charges were take from my account at the time the food was delivered but when i checked out  i was given the bill for room service and other charges  i was not given the option of having it debited from credit card and i would have preferred that to having more charges added to my already expensive bill   maybe i misunderstood but i thought when i booked the trip through expedia that everything except resort fees were paid for but when i checked in i was charged another      which was refunded but i was not prepared for that  i could have budgeted a little better for the trip    nevertheless  it was taken care of  my next trip will be a planned a little better and i will stay somewhere a little less expensive and somewhere that provides transportation to more places  considering we were out all day  i didn t need such a fancy resort  i still think the resort was beautiful and staff are very friendly       read more   read less

want    bucks to do so   bed was comfy  and i didn t hear any noise from hallway neighbors    my room was  th floor i think  and there was still considerable noise from the street  nothing that ear plugs couldn t fix     the elevators  despite being numerous  notoriously run slow    rooms do not have fridge or microwaves   those are really the only downsides    honestly  if you are coming from

upgraded  but this is not about the keycard  this is about your silly  facility fee   exactly  what facilities did i use    the toilet  i was under the impression that that was covered in the regular hotel fee  we got no complimentary coffee  no hair dryer in our room  no complimentary breakfast in the lobby either  so what did my facility fee cover  that was never explained  the only thing we  used  was the bed  bathroom and tv  which comes with any hotel room  and should be included in the price of the hotel  those shouldn t be considered as   extras  or  facility fees   moreover  expedia advertises this scummy hotel as having free wifi  hmmm  so if that s part of the facility fee  then it s not free  i ve been to ny lots of times  no hotel has ever charged this ridiculous fee  it s like  you charged me twice for the same room  the only reason i picked this hotel  was because with the pride festivities going on  everything was booked  or the prices were higher than usual  this hotel was advertised as      night on expedia  my brother paid for me and his daughter  my niece  to stay there for   nights  the price was      total  that should ve covered everything that comes with the hotel       read more   read less maids either came at   am or    pm  very sporadic and inconvenient times  was  not notified of a     per night parking fee  when i attempted to park  the lot

this is how the unregistered guest were discovered      i was changed into   room  disappointing as i was with my kids   the new room had dirty bedsheets  no toilet paper and door lock not functioning  not nice given that somebody maybe issued a key for an occupied roon as it happend to me   the next day when i returned to the room the room was not done     i called and the reception required me to go down and get keys for another room   i was extremely disappointed to be forced to change again the room     but there was no way to stay in my room sunce they would not make it therefore me and my kids had to move to another room  this time   beds     the new room had the phone not working  in summary a poorly managed property  a lot of staff is chinese as well and speek little or broken

the first thing we did not like was that the man who checked us in acted like we were his least favorite people even though we had never met and i greeted him normally  secondly  he told us we had a second floor room and we had   pieces of luggage   one of them extremely heavy  i asked where the elevator was and he said there wasn t one  he showed us a map of where the room was and wished us a good night  we would never have found the room and we would have had to hump all those bags upstairs by ourselves if the van driver had not come and helped us  big thumbs down to the desk clerk   he might have offered us a ground floor room  secondly  there was no way to turn on a light in the room when we got there  no wall switches or card swipes   had to walk into a dark room and feel around for a light switch for the desk lamp  the shower head delivered a very weak stream of water and the shower curtain was broken on the shower head side of the tub  so water all over the floor  the only reason i gave the staff a good rating is because of the one guy  the van driver who was wearing a cap with the word  security  on it  was nice and kind and helpful  we booked via expedia and thought we were getting a room with a complimentary breakfast  as it advertises on line  but if you book a discounted room  you don t get a free breakfast  no where did it state that during the booking

american horror story  the elevators are old open slow shake and your never sure your going to make it to your floor  the dingy brown carpet makes the hallways dark and scary  the rooms are awful so small you cant move  you take   steps in the front door and run into a bed  cant get around the bed because of the desk at the end so have to throw luggage over the bed to get it to the other side of the room  you run into the desk everytime you need to get to the bathroom  not sure how multiple adults are supposed to stay in such a small room  i had one adult and one teenager and we had no room  the pictures on the website of the rooms are not accurate at all false advertising  not to mention the paper thin doors and walls  every day you could hear staff loadly on thier walkie talkies  no insullation for the windows could hear streer traffic sirens and construstion all day and night  the bathroom was horrible again so small you could barely turn around  tub was stained  paint peeling everywhere  faucet piece falling off  no ventalation whatso ever in the bathroom so when you take a shower the condensation builds on the ceiling so when you get out your being constantly pelted with

lounge chairs  this being summer and over    degrees on any given day  a little shade is necessary  it was so hot we couldn t stay at the pool for more than an hour as we had nowhere to retreat from the sun  also  the pool towels were lacking as well  in two days we had to ask for the towels to be replenished and on sunday the pool attendant said we would have to wait an hour for towels and that we should go back to our room and take our room towels to use that day  the lack of people at the pool would probably be an indication that the abscense of shade and towels was an issue for others as well  we come to florida to spend time at the pool and to not be able to do what we love to do on vacation will certainly come into play when we schedule our next visit  unless the umbrella situation

is      and does some really nice meals for those times when you just want to eat local for breakfast or any other time  i did not use bar or sports facilities  internet was good and international phone calls are free as part of the additional resort charges  staff were helpful and there is a good left luggage service for the day you leave    dollars per bag and then you free to do a further explore  we left bags and then went to central park for a few hours until departure time  we had a room that was billed as   double beds  there was   of us and taking this room option over   separate rooms saved us about       which is a big chunk of spending money  only real downside was the mattress sagged towards the middle  i imagine the rooms are used as upgraded twins the majority of the time  this meant you gravitated to the centre  as a single it was fine  but struggled as a double  shower  coffee making facilities  fridge and so on in the room were fine  cleanliness very good  so

choice this hotel and paid more to stay here because it had the valet parking that several others in the area did not have  there was another hotel with limited hotel parking that was less and we chose not to stay there because we know how the parking in ny can be  yet  on the  nd night we arrived back at  am from being out with my family and was told that the valet was full  this was absolutely ridiculous  my husband then had to park over two blocks away on the street  if we wanted street parking there were many other hotels that were less expensive where we could have stayed  what also makes matters worst is i called this hotel before book to confirm the valet parking and they did not mention that it s limited valet      positive   the front desk staff was pleasant  check was smooth  the room was pretty clean  i think they cold have paid a little more attention cleaning the bathroom but not significant enough to call housekeeping to come back  the area felt save and

a linen closet  you could barely open the door to get into the room  once inside  there was no room to walk or relax  the bathroom door opened right into the toilet leaving no space  the wall on the

staff however was very incompetent and rude  i couldn t even pay a fee to check in early because the girl at the counter said she had to call a manager to see if any rooms are ready  honestly i feel like she just didn t want to deal with me or the   other people kept waiting because there was an elderly couple that checked in right before me   they got a room  everyone else was forced to wait for  pm  she didn t call a manager  she was on her phone texting  and while she was checking in the elderly couple she answered her personal phone to chat  talk about unprofessional  same thing happened at check out  i only needed the room for a few hours to get some sleep so i didn t even stay the whole night  i m waiting at the counter for at least      minutes before someone assisted me now mind you there are   girls at the counter this time around and no line  i was the only one in the lobby  one was actually on the phone with a customer so she obviously couldn t help me  fine  the other one was texting on her phone   completely ignoring me  i was really unsatisfied with the staff  the one one that actually made me feel like a valued customer was the man that checked me in  smiled when

for a partial refund  he refused and said that we had booked room via expedia  we should ask for refund or compensation from expedia not the hotel directly  i was cross and continued to explain to this guy that the bunker bed was what we had promised to our daughter and now my daughter was so frustrated up there  maybe due to my persistence  he at last told me that there was only and the last

 we followed their instructions to call for a shuddle when we were ready   that was at     pm  after about    minutes of waiting  we called the front desk who told us they d call the driver to find out where he was  after another    minutes we called again and they said he was on his way  long story short  he arrived at the airport at     pm  in the hour we sat there waiting we saw all the other airport shuttles come by     times so i d definitely recommend any other hotel   when we talked to the driver he told us he was on his lunch break  we talked to jordan at the front desk about our frustration and he was short  rude  and seemed like he could really care less  when we asked why it took so long he said he didn t know the driver was on his lunch break  i asked why he didn t know and he said because he was also on break  i guess my frustration lies in the fact that every other business functions while employees are on breaks  but apparently this hotel shuts down while the employees take their breaks  the room was overpriced and for the price to leave your car overnight  you would hope they could get you a shuddle after a long day of travel in less than an hour

customer service     i cannot say the same for orbitz  after speaking to two customer service reps  who offered me coupons for future stays but were not authorized to issue a refund  i spoke with a manager who explained there was nothing he could do  because orbitz s terms of service permit them to give you a different  less expensive room than what you paid for  and there is nothing you can do about it  that right  i paid for a king room  they gave me a much smaller queen room  and then refused to refund the difference  the csrs i spoke with at least tried to help  the manager clearly did not care whether i got what i paid the company for or not  i ve been using orbitz for over    years and have had mostly positive experiences  but they completely dropped the ball this time  and i m

wanted housekeeping to come up to change the sheets and i replied that i wanted to know why it wasnt done in the first place to which he replied  i have no idea i dont work in housekeeping  he was rude and snarky and in no way tried to calm the situation  housekeeping came up and called the keeper from the a m to tell her what happened at which time i told her i had pictures which killed the

to go to epcot  but missed that bus  get the magic kingdom one as it drops you at the monorail station for epcot too  then get a bus to disney springs back later as you can walk from the stop to the

which in itself is ridiculous  and when we returned to retrieve them they told us what we paid was only half  the second half was required to take our bags  the bellman didn t accept credit card or allow us to charge the amount to our room  it was the end of our trip  and we weren t expecting to need more cash so we d used our remainder to give our uber driver an excellent cash tip on the way back to the hotel  had we known about the additional fee  we would have tipped using the app and saved the cash for this payment  instead  we had to leave the hotel to go find an atm  when we were already running late for the airport due to unexpected traffic delays  we had to go back into the storage unit to help the bellman find our bags because there was no organizational system  they were on an entirely different shelf from where he was looking  we wasted    minutes on this process when you consider that we had to wait in line for the bellman twice as he retrieved bags for other guests one at a time  we missed our flight by   minutes  as a result  which cost us hundreds of dollars  additionally  the room was underwhelming  only the lobby is luxurious  save your money       read more

hotel rooms i have ever been placed in  it was extremely small  around    sq feet    hot water was not working  old tv on a tiny counter  no room at all for luggage  no refrigerator  no coffee pot  no nothing   absolutely not worth the price of the room   ever    we sent in an online review that night and the manager called our room and told us she would have us switched the next day  however when doing what we were told to do the hotel staff was not aware of the request so that was another ordeal    we were then told by the staff to come back after   and they would have a new room ready for us  we showed up around      and were told  we were lucky because they just happened to have   room        well  i have a problem with this because we were told we would have a better room but now it was  just our luck    the next room was much better  i do feel sorry for anyone paying the price and getting the room we had to begin with    location was a good central location for what we needed   if i need a good central hotel again i will consider staying here  but i will call directly to see what kind of room they are placing us in before hand       read more   read less i have prepaid

with your stay  also the event that was there was very loud in the pool till about   in the morning and they were loud  there should be a limit to that  the action were unfair to young ones around and the pool couldnt be access for   days  also they should have a well established kiddie pool area with sprinklers or something fun because not all kids can enjoy the big pool  also a long time ago

thanksgiving  we re in the macy s thanksgiving day parade   the location is perfect for our needs  and it s a terrific value for the three of us  this year we stayed in the nikola tesla room  just for fun    for the  nd year in a row  my client has booked us into this spectacular vintage property  completed in       the art deco feel is there throughout the hotel  comfortable cozy rooms with super strong hot water pressure and easy to use heating ac  i wanted to extend my stay  the staff was friendly  the rooms were clean and spacious  and everything we needed was with a short walk  the view from our room was amazing and the breakfast in the morning was great  you can t go wrong with the new yorker  i will definitely stay again  great  my chicken was fast and efficient  the check in staff and concierge were outstanding  great service  my room is a little small  but i m      so most rooms are small  the bed was very comfortable  i have a slight problem with my television which was quickly repaired  i traveled to nyc with my family during thanksgiving to see the macy s parade and visit some of the sights  i was very happy with the new yorker  the staff was very courteous and accommodating during a very busy time  we had a corner view room on an upper story and the empire  i was so happy with our stay at the new yorker  you can t beat the location  the staff was amazing and having the   dining options in the hotel is great  the diner offers just about anything you re in the mood for  the subway is located just outside of the hotel and madison  upon check in we were met with pretty unhappy staff  nobody seemed very happy  there was no offer of assistance to get the luggage to the room  the door man who you would think would help you get a cab was not very helpful either  every time in was faster to request another  the hotel is clean  the staff is great  the price is reasonable  for manattan  and the amenities are complete  i use the subway as much as possible when in manhattan and the new yorker is within a few yards of   subway lines and within a five or six minute walk of    more    each year  when we go to see the macy s thanksgiving day parade in the hersld square area  we stay at tha wyndham new yorker  perfect location  excellent security and hotel services and most appreciated indoor access to the tick tock diner  a place that offers quality meals   we spent a week here  celebrating my wife s birthday in nyc and this hotel was an excellent choice  perfectly located to arrive from jfk airport and to do our daily tips  penn station and the subway is at the corner  madison square garden is next door  came very handy when we  booked a last minute trip to ny with my daughter in law and   month granddaughter  we actually struggled to find many hotels that would accommodate   adults and a baby as we wanted   beds and a crib  booked a deluxe double       at the new yorker and couldn t have been happier    i only live an hour from the city but i have never stayed overnight until recently at this hotel  all i have to say is that i couldn t have asked for a better first experience  i was staying over in the city for a very special occasion and this hotel made it even better  i got  me and my friend stayed stayed here on our first trip to new york  it seems to be the most popular in the travel agents   new york forums amongst many different travellers  we got the train and off at pennyslvania station it s right across the road so easy access and a short  i was not a guest of the new yorker wyndam hotel  however  i was so disappointed by the hotel staff that i will never stay there  my husband was staying there on business  which happened to overlap with his birthday  in the    years  we have been together  we have never been  we had two rooms on the   th floor of the new yorker  the plus point were the views directly of the empire state building and the friendly staff in the hotel  especially the cheery guy who serves the coffees and teas in the foyer  the shower was a bit weird it was either very  stayed in the new yorker hotel for   nights on our first night stayed in a room on floor    the room was very tired and dated needed a lick of paint but on our second night we were moved to the   st floor which had been refurbished and was lovely very clean   towels and soap and  really good stay here  reception is beautiful n staff really helpful  in the morning there is a small coffee bar open serving drinks and pastries  lifts are a bit of a pain stopping at every floor when you are on the   th or   th floor  rooms are very clean but do need  great location close to empire state building  macys and walking distance to times square  tic tock diner attached to the hotel good food and quite reasonable  rooms in hotel are small but adequate for    security is good in the hotel  the staff on reception are unfriendly we  great location  we traveled into nyc by train and it is only a half block from penn station  they upgraded us to a corner suite with an incredible view so we were blown away by their service  we will be back  this hotel has been around a long time and despite renovations is weary  the decor in the room was dull and beige  my room did not have a good view and was dreary and dismal  not much light was let in from the window  while the bedding was new and updated  the furniture  stayed for two nights on a brief trip to ny  the location is great  right by penn station and loads of shops nearby  we arrived much earlier than expected and were pre checked in and were able to leave our bags whilst we went sight seeing  the room was good  although pretty  spent   nights at the new yorker and we opted for a double metro room with a view  great view of the empire state building  only downside to this was it was a little noisy with the traffic and the sirens  but i expected it in new york  rooms were clean and the double metro  just reopened does pub food  not a massive menu but what it does do it does very well love the place  good beer and wine also you can take dogs into the bar where there are doggie treats for them  service is excellent and everyone is very friendly  this is the third year we have stayed at the new yorker and i wouldn t stay anywhere else when visiting nyc  the views are breathtaking  the rooms are clean and spacious  the staff is friendly and professional  i always recommend this hotel for travelers  what a great palace woww    is was a veerry vwerry nice oplace to vit with the friends and family   soooo great palace to visit  soo leaceful nd enjoyfeul expirience it was   i just cant explain that amaging tour woowww sooo great  soooo sooo goood tourrr great location   easy check in   good service  hotel is very accessible to all new york attractions   wyndham membership makes it easy to book   use points to book stay very quickly  historical hotel near metro   bus terminals for other cities  great location and friendly hotel  the building retains the character of when it was built and some of the rooms are a little small  but comfortable and provide a safe base for what just needs to be a place to eat  drink and rest  across the road is the madison square garden   lynda was amazing at check in  we loved the tick tock dinner  the trattoria next door and the restaurant below  everything was amazing including the location  i love the   s and this was all of the charm but service of a chain hotel that you trust  the maid service was so  a disappointing stay  the rooms are small  very dated  dark  no amenities  the hotel is busy and crowded with waits for reception and even bag check  the location is not great   busy and noisy part of town  limited good restaurants near by  far from good places to visit like  we paid extra for city view and got a corner room with a view  but the size of a walk in closet  comfortable bed  clean linens  but old faucets made it hard to regulate heat in shower  either scalding or cold  adequate closet space  but one torn chair  so heavy and cumbersome it  this is my go to hotel in the city  you can t get better value for money in midtown manhattan than at the new yorker  in my opinion  and i ve always felt welcomed and right at home  staff are all professional and kind  the establishment has an environmentally friendly approach   great hotel  requested a high floor with view  was not disappointed  could not do early check in because they had been sold out the night before  based on traveling during christmas season we were not very surprised that they couldn t take us early  left our bags with bell  friendly convenient and very clean and comfortable  great location  easy access to train station and theater district  a lot of great attractions and restaurants nearby  nice in hotel restaurant and bar  it is the second time we stay at the wyndham newyorker at we had the best holiday ever  everything worked  from the tours  the food and the hotel  this time we got a room away from the street and we slept like babies  a perfect week  firstly the positives   the wyndham new yorker has a lot of history  there s a small free museum downstairs   and you can t really beat the location  literally a stone s throw from madison square garden and       mins from empire state building and times square  there are   or    friendly staff and lovely hotel in the heart of of the city  close to all shops and the empire state building also time square was a    min walk away  would say the only down side was there was no drinks facilities in the room but seeing as there are shops everywhere around this  beautifully decorated for the holidays  this historic art deco hotel with modern conveniences less than two blocks from penn station and macy s has larger than normal nyc rooms with very comfortable beds  exceptional staff service  a    hour retro diner and excellent italian  stayed for   nights last week  first off the good points  hotel central and within walking distance of penn station  macy s  empire state building  times square and a decent walk to central park  bad points  on checking in we where given the key cards to a room on the   th floor  the new yorker is in a prime location  we went to nyc to see billy joel at madison square garden  the hotel is across the street  it is also steps from penn station  the hotel is a historical building and they do a great job highlighting it s history to include an exhibit on the  the new yorker is well located and that s why i loved to stay here  and i love korean food around this hotel there is tons o koreans restaurants so perfect  the rooms are big enough  and clean  the only downside was when i came off the lifts the floor carpets needed an upgrade   this is an amazing historic property  we ended up in the tesla room  where nikola tesla lived and died  i was so honored to be randomly assigned this room  everything was wonderful expect the water temperature  the shower went from pleasant to scalding and then to freezing  we  room was small but very efficient for the two of us  only problem we had  which is usually not a complaint  is getting cold water    location was great   close proximity to times square  subway  and much more  the tick tock diner connected to the hotel is reasonably priced and  my family and i had an amazing stay from           our room was extremely spacious with   beds    closets and a separate sitting area with   chairs and a small table  the property was very well maintained and the staff were all wonderful  the location was perfect for sight  second time staying here  and i d have to say i d be hard pressed to find a better place to stay when visiting nyc  if you re in town to see a show at the garden  relax  it ll take you all of    seconds to walk to the front doors  since most shows don t start exactly at the  excellent location  friendly staff  fast check in check out  spacious double room in  th floor  stylish lobby  walking distance to times square  many restaurant and coffeeshop around    h grocery store in front of the hotel  parking is   usd and   usd for suv  for hotel guests   large  busy centrally located hotel  awesome facilities  gym  and tick tick diner nice for breakfast  rooms and bathroom are neat and tidy although quite small  lovely view of the eps and surrounding buildings  only reason why i didn t give   stars is the hotel was extremely  easy  friendly check in  suite room was a great size for new york  the view from the   th floor is amazing  we has a clear shot of the empire state and msg  closets were spacious  and the mini keurig was amazing  also loved the stocked mini fridge  water  coke  and diet coke  it  ideal hotel to stay     mins from time square   on the junction of    st    th ave  rooms clean   tidy   but a bit of modernisation wouldn t go amiss  plenty of restaurants   bars close by  italian restaurant connected to hotel is top quality   reasonably priced  would stay  had an excellent stay at the new yorker hotel  rooms very comfortable with good amenities  staff very helpful   polite  excellent diner one side of the hotel  also a very good italian restaurant on the other side  hotel very well located for getting around new york  most  the title of my review really says most of what i wanted to express  the new yorker is an iconic manhattan hotel  i would be disappointed at having to stay anywhere else  except maybe the waldorf astoria   the thing that makes this hotel so appealing is it s history and  i had read reviews of this hotel before i went but i cannot fault my stay  got a queen room with no view  the room was very clean  although not the upgraded ones everything worked and was fine for our stay  we were there for a week and it was a great location  just over the  the newyorker is situated beside madison square gardens a stones throw from times square  we were warned before we went that nyc hotel rooms are small and yes they are but as you are just sleeping there it really wasnt an issue  the check in process was seamless  great security   really nice stay in nyc  hotel was great  location is excellent  penn station across the street we used to go to newark for a hockey game  plenty to do close by like empire state building  macy s  highline etc  short walk to times square  ate twice at tick tock dinner located  our rooms were great and large for new york  the service was excellent  the subway was right across the street and cabs were always available  i would highly recommend choosing this hotel  i will stay on again on our next trip to new york  i ve never written a review on tripadvisor but i felt compelled to do so after my recent stay at this hotel  i don t care about how modern or hip or whatever bells and whistles most people care about  location and view are more important for me  i usually spend very little time  room size was horrible maybe    x     shower leak all night  made housekeeping aware of the problem was never corrected  vanity space maybe   or   inch very very tiny bathroom  horrible for the price that was paid over         new years weekend  will never stay at this place  we got a great price although our room was tiny  however  new bathroom bathrobe and coffee which not all room have  elevators were always quick and wireless was fine  perfect location and easy block from penn station  no wait for cabs on that long line highly recommend  perfect location within walking distance of penn station  shops and times square  hotel could do with a bit of updating but think it was just the style of hotel  small rooms but perfecting fine as don t spend a lot of time in room  water was lovely but bath was grubby  i m sure the new yorker was a grand old dame in its hey day but it feels very tired today  heating in rooms was very ordinary   it was either full blast hot  which made sleeping tricky  or cold  shower wasn t great and the rooms are very small  the staff were pleasant enough  stayed at the new yorker hotel for   night s with my wife after new year  the hotel is in a fantastic location  right next to penn station and madison square garden  it s also a stone s throw away from the empire state building and times square  as for the hotel it s pretty  we visited new york for the first time over nye       we had an amazing stay and the new yorker provided a clean and calm retreat from the hustle and bustle  our room was large by new york standards and older but always clean  the tic tock diner downstairs was a godsend with  if you want the real new york this is your hotel  right in the middle of the action walking distance to times square the empire state building and most important macys   couldn t of asked for a nicer hotel and more helpful staff  rooms were beautiful and clean beds were huge to  spent our honeymoon at the new yorker  check in was pretty easy and all very friendly i did e mail in advance to see if they could do anything as it s our honeymoon unfortunately they couldn t but we were promised a bottle of wine when we checked in and was told this would be in  we stayed here in january and the hotel is in a fabulous location  the rooms are small which is what you expect in a large city however the hotels is looking a little tired  the rooms need to be redecorated along with the corridors  the plumbing is noisy and you can here  what a delight this hotel is  steeped in history  all of which is proudly preserved  whether within the elegance of the hotel or in its small museum downstairs  it holds many stories within its walls  the staff are delightful at all times  check in was fast and proficient yes  hotel was quick to get to from newark airport  we upgraded to a suite which was no trouble for the staff  all staff were friendly and went out their way to help  great location opposite madison square garden and close to penn station  our suite was on level    and from the  great location and lobby staff  kindly upgraded us due to a birthday  but problems with the most important thing  wasn t clean  visible dust dirt layers on tops of tile  baseboards  bathroom light  debris on floor found when opened curtains  housekeeping didn t come to clean  the hotel staff were awesome from the front desk  housekeeping and security staff  room was big for nyc although a little older but very clean and well appointed  wonderful lobby area with old nyc charm  met some nice guests waiting on taxi or uber    doorman was great  food at  i was very pleased with resort  it s a beautiful property  close proximity to disney parks   disney springs is a plus  the rooms were very nice  the double queen with bunk beds is perfect if traveling with a child ren   my daughter loved having her own space   tv    the hidden fees added up to     per a night  just the fee for   nights costed me      the shuttle service information given by the hotel front deck was wrong  the pick up stops were wrong  i have reported it to hotel front desk but they seems to not care  i lucky to met with  i was there for the fsoma conference and had a great time  i hope we have our conference there again next year  the staff was very friendly and helpful   and rick at the bell station was extremely helpful in giv ng me directions  thank you for a great stay  wyndham grand orlando resort bonnet creek is a luxury resort with family friendly theme  if you purchase a room with balcony  you can view the walt disney fireworks  the pools have a  theme  with a  legend  of a lost pirate base that is now the ponds  breakfast was at      at the wyndham grand bonnet creek  it was everything we hope for on our disney vacation  the family room with the bunk beds made sleeping arrangements easily  the vanity outside the bathroom was key to keeping us on schedule  it was a great disney vacation  i met my friend here for a girls weekend  it was great  nice spa  beautiful grounds and good food  rick  the bellman was so very helpful in arranging things for us  i will probably return with my family   there s something for everyone there  best hotel i ve ever stayed in by far stayed on the   th floor seen fireworks every night gorgeous room back bat food at poolside is lovely  and i must say staff are so polite and attentive but rick is by far the best there he was so helpful and polite and gave me great  i was staying here while attending a conference that was also scheduled at this hotel  what a treat  great food  beds and wonderful service from all the staff  enjoyed every minute  i tried several new foods and drinks and loved everything  went on this trip with my wife  was so easy to get around with shuttles and lots to do with kids from water slides and pools  favourite part was definitely feeding the ducks  coy fish  catfish turtles and birds  everyone from check in to check out were extremely accommodating  the room and grounds were very clean and well kept  especially  the bell hop rick was so friendly and informative on what to do around the resort  he was the best ending for our stay   thank you rick      this resort is amazing  lots of places to eat  things to do  and multiple pools and hot tubs  we walked the      mile lap around the lake at night  and it was perfectly safe and enjoyable  the room was clean and the fixtures were of high quality  we would definitely stay here  i took a chance on hotwire and i ended up at this resort  i was excited because  my wife and i are trying to stay at every hotel on walt disney world property  drive to hotel   as you make the turn onto chelonia pkwy it builds up some sort of anticipation of seeing what the  take one sip from the fruit infused complimentary water at the entrance and you have already kicked things off on a good note  ultra comfort included with beds inclusive of multiple sheets and pillows fit for a gladiator most decorated  indulge in the breakfast buffet and eat  the stay at the wyndham grand was all in all an exceptional experience  the grounds were immaculate and the pools and hot tubs provided the much needed relaxation i was looking for  the hotel staff were kind and courteous and eager to help  however  as part of a timeshare  the newly updated rooms were so nice and the bed heavenly food was delicious from the special omelette cooked to order  spanish cuisine at lunch and dinner was special with crab cakes and grouper  the chef prepared everything perfectly from presentation to flavors was there for  the staff at the front desk and sales team were all most helpful in ensuring my experience was most pleasant  i was barely there for    hours but felt the warmness of the staff and experienced the beauty of the resort  this resort is beautiful  we ve stayed here previously  their restaurants have delicious food  there service is fantastic  amazing location  just one complain  this time the room we were in wasn t maintained well  the bathroom handle was falling off  we were put in an accessible  i travel to orlando often and have stayed at this property several times in the past  stayed recently and was surprised to see updated rooms  shocked as i believe this hotel is still fairly new  the new rooms look great  looks like new furniture  carpet and updated color  from check in to check out  the hospitality was exceptional  deep blu was a truly grand experience  chef mclamb  food was outstanding  and our server kathy  awesome   exceeded all expectations  we are so glad to have had the opportunity to stay at the wyndham grand  you guys  this resort was fantastic in every waythe rooms were clean and the view was magnificent  the price was right at the right price  not to much or no to little  for a real   start this place was amazing i cant wait to go back  from start  checking in to checking out and everything in between was a great experience  everyone went above and beyond  family wedding  so also used as a venue for ceremony and reception  did a fabulous job   stayed at this resort during labor day weekend of        beautiful resort  huge lobby with coffee shop  great clean sleeping rooms that offered what is needed   big pool for adults and kids with food bar services within steps of your pool chairs   take advantage of surrounding  my family and i had a great stay at wyndham grand resort bonnet creek  i will list my pros and cons here  pros    location is amazing     minutes or less to disney parks and about    minutes to universal    rates vary but i was able to get a great rate thru trip advisors   we were immediately hit up to buy a timeshare upon arrival  the shower took at least    minutes to warm up  bus service to disney was not on the times advertised and ended up taking almost an hour to wait for the bus and drive to one park  had to uber after waiting    minutes  extremely annoyed  the website lists a parlor  junior pres and presidential suite  however  i called to get rates and first person i spoke to stated those did not exist and repeatedly asked if i was on the right website  i had to read her everything i saw and she continued to  wanted to stay close to magic kingdom so i picked this place  i wish i knew it had so much to do on property i wouldn t have bothered to go anywhere else  this place was so amazing  lots of pools  lazy rivers  walking paths around the lake  places to eat  so much to do at this  transportation for disney is severely lacking  couldn t even get to the parks at opening or if you stayed till closing  the rest of the experience was good and their breakfast is amazing  we wouldn t stay here again though  the hotel a little outdated but cleanliness was satisfactory  the breakfast was good and our server  ron  outstanding  however  the day we arrived there was a huge lizard in the hallway of our hotel block  inside   and as we walked the premises there were tons of them  had a great time staying in this hotel  with pools and grills  also was able to watch fireworks from the room i used every night  so i really enjoyed my stay here  wish i can go back and book again in this hotel  hotel is great  staff is not like being at a disney hotel  in a disney resort staff is everywhere to do everything for you  staff is minimal here  it s not a bad thing  your just on your own  also  the buses  are slow  if your traveling with kids it s very hard  be outside  just recently stayed at this hotel for our trip to disney world  first  the service at this resort was impeccable and outstanding  my girlfriend and i checked in very late  shannon rich  the representative at the registration graciously greeted us and checked us in efficiently   hotel had a lot to offer  spacious room with a coffee machine and fridge  there was a safe and plenty room for storage  best of all i could bring my yorkie with me  two large pools  hot tub  restaurant and fire pit  surrounded by a walk way around the lake and some ply ground  this hotel is amazing and very comfortable and accommodating  we wanted a room on the higher floor to view the fireworks and were placed on the fourth floor  when we arrived at our room the view was not that great  the bellman immediately called the front desk to see if a room  we really expected something different but what we got was good  not very good  but wasn t amazing  we stayed in the hotel which is part of a resort with holiday apartments  the resort is spread out over the entire property so if you want to use the arcade  you need to walk  this is one of the best resort i ever stood in  so close to all parks  very clean and just upgraded  we recommended to other travelers  nice big pool area  great restaurant   blue  everyone that works there has been great   we stayed in the new yorker hotel this january   it was a lovely hotel staff were so so lovely rooms can be a bit small but we were moved to a bigger room with no problems at all   staff were on hand all the time and you could ask them anything about the area   would stay here  while i always enjoy the  old new york  feel of this hotel  the hidden facility fees put a damper on my trip  especially since they refused to put it on the company card that booked the trip without    authorizations and a spare kidney  better to just raise the room rate and be  just back in ireland from another great visit to this fabulous hotel   staff are brillant so helpful and informative big shout out to lovely linda at front desk who is so kind and professional  we will be back in april for my moms birthday   cant wait stayed here for   nights at the end of january       and we where very impressed  we had read a few reviews complaining about room size and heating  but being in the heart of manhattan  we found it a comfortable size  and the heating was fine   it is in a  perfect location to  this is not likely to be the smartest hotel you ll ever stay in  but it is very conveniently located  and is good value for money  right near penn station so it is easy and cheap to get there from jfk  great local deli nearby  which is really convenient for a nice breakfast or  we stayed here at the beginning of december  it is a great location  being within walking distance to the majority of attractions in nyc  in my opinion  the decor is very dated  i felt like i was in the      s  what i imagined it to be like   the beds were small also  i d say  i needed to change from a twin to a suite for a trip next week to nyc and was fortunate enough to connect with neida a natural commicator and excellent representative of the hotel  not only was she able to deal with my request efficiently  but more importantly with nice good  absolutely loved this hotel  location is great  so handy for times square  train station etc  also plenty of shops and cafes around it  hotel was also very clean and staff friendly  tick tick restaurant located in hotel was amazing for breakfast and desserts  we also had a view  just returned from   nights here  hotel location is excellent but hotel inside is very dates  rooms are small and dark  plug sockets are not practical at all and limited storage space  very clean though cant be faulted for that  reception was very rude on check in i had   rooms  went to ny with   friends  we shared a room with   beds and it was amazing  the hotel is very clean  beds are comfortable  rooms with an amazing view  the decoration is cool  bathrooms are a little small but its ok  the price we payed was very low compared to other hotels  the staff are lovely and the rooms are huge for new york  it s close to lots of sights  we really enjoyed ourselves and highly recommend this hotel for a family  couples  or business  we will go back  great hotel all the staff very friendly and helpful  rooms clean but dated like most original hotels in new york  the hotel is dog friendly and we had a couple of noisy dogs in the next room  mentioned this to receptionist and she upgraded us to a better room  excellent service  clean  great location  a very professional staff  would highly recommend this hotel when visiting nyc for business or pleasure  if driving park your car across the street at the icon garage  the cab and rapid transit will handle your transport needs  after choosing to visit new york our break took us to the wny hotel it was a pleasure to stay there the hotel was in a perfect location to tour nyc   the hotel has a nice retro feeling and some great features and a small museum where you can find out all about the history of  great hotel in manhattan  close to empire state and subway  i walked from here to central park and ground zero  close to tavern bar  great food and drink  rooms clean  nice staff  buffet breakfast ok too  we have just returned from a   night stay at this hotel  out first impressions were that the hotel appeared to be dated and the room was basic and small  however  we were on floor    and had the most amazing views  the hotel is in the most amazing location as it is within  jose was phenomenal  he handled me with compassion and professionalism  he calmed me down and diffused a potential blow up  my reservations were incorrect  wyndham assured me it would be corrected by the time i arrived on saturday  it was not  jose patiently worked with me  i return to this hotel every year for the westminster kennel club dog show  the staff go out of their way to make you feel like an honored guest  two in particular  mohammed and neida are so wonderful with their help to make sure my stay is always superb  i had to ask for a  the hotel is famous for many things  one being where nikola tesla lived and sadly died back in       there are still questions being asked about what happened once he died and all of his research stored at the hotel  but back to the drink  to the left of the lobby  downstairs  stayed here at the beginning of this year  was a lovely stay and the staff were so kind  the room was a nice size however the shower didn t work very well and water came out of both the bath tap and the shower head at the same time causing very little power in the shower water   clean  comfy and a great area  the hotel is clean  especially the rooms  the beds are very comfortable  the rooms are of a good size  it is in a great area of manhattan  very central to start your days out in nyc we stayed in the new yorker hotel from  th     th december  our first impression of the hotel was that it was very grand and not what we are used to back home  travel lodges and premier inns  being an absolute christmas nut i was amazed by the beautiful tree in the lobby  the  everyone from the doorman  bellman  front desk  reservations  catering and sales give fabulous service  i have stayed st this hotel for    years and never been disappointed  it always feels like i m  coming home  when i arrive  i always choose the new yorker for my   monthly family trips to new york  for me there is no choice   great location  great staff  fabulous building and comfortable room  i always have a twin double bed metro room   the hotel has a lot of character and history  the staff cannot  myself and daughter have just returned from our trip and stayed at the new yorker for   nights  hotel is lovely and historic  staff were fantastic  room was an adequate size for us  very clean and warm and lovely bath tub with plenty hot water  we could pick no faults at all   after reading other reviews i fear people are missing the point of this hotel  the decor in all areas from the lobby to the corridors is definitely of art deco influences  what others are seeing as  outdated  is merely the hotels choice of decor in line with the style and age of  first of all the tap water is so dirty so showering was out of the question  see photo   paid for a suite   three people got one bed    what are they thinking in the reception  never paid so much for such poor quality  when we arrived late at night they knew it would be three of us  we booked a suite  wow  and payed almost      for one night  when we came to the room we had one bed and one pullout bed that wasn t even made so we had to call room service and they came    mins later  got the  i have stayed here before and had a wonderful time  this time was horrible  the first night our hotel key didn t work  instead of changing the cards like the security guy said they made us change rooms  they told us we would be upgraded  our room was the exact same with a worse  very nice and clean hotel with large rooms  very focused on guest safety as you need a room key to show to get from lobby to elevators for guests  very attentive to guest satisfaction and even had someone knock on the door to ask how the service was  two restaurants are off the  our ny suite was adequate in housing   of us who were there for the westminster dog show including our show dog  special thanks to kelvin diaz for accommodating our entire group of handlers and dogs on the same floor  kudos to the entire staff for being extremely helpful and  just returned from   nights at new yorker  great location for sure  door and security staff are great  the women on reception are less so  very abrupt and prickly  the room was a good size spotlessly clean and beds very comfortable  only real downside is no tea   coffee  i stayed with my daughter in dec      for a second time and during the course of the stay there was  unfortunately  cause for complaint  when i arrived home  via email i was dealt with extremely professionally by megan who i believe is a customer service manager  she resolved my  very grand hotel with a great gatsby feel to it  our room was a little on the small side   but it was perfectly clean and bed was comfortable which is needed after long days sightseeing  we had some trouble with the shower not running very hot on out first day  but it seemed to  we would like to commend all the staff at the wyndham new yorker  who carried out their duties excellently  extremely helpful and accommodating  our room     was a perfect environment to unwind  sleep following our days of sightseeing around the city  we arrived at the new yorker hotel very tired with   children in our party  when we checked in we got told they needed a credit card to take      plus tax off this was for the  nights we was staying  when we questioned this we got told we had to pay room tax per night  none of  the new yorker hotel  location  location  location  see the sights  madison square garden  fifth avenue  empire state building  herald square  close at hand  enjoy true new york experience  ride the subways  walk the neighborhoods  meet the new yorker people from the streets to  stayed at this location for a january event and was pleasantly surprised when we received an upgrade through wyndham rewards  in addition the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful  the room we were put in had the extra room which made the stay even better  as rooms in nyc  i have been attending the wkc shows since      and have stayed at the new yorker since       fabulous location  clean rooms and comfy beds  one short block to penn stn and msg    short blocks to times square and one long block to macy s  talk about location location location    just returned after a   night stay  we could not fault this hotel  yes it is an older hotel as people have stated but it adds to the charms  surprised to read some of the comments  the staff were fantastic  friendly and helpful with any questions we had  the hotel felt so safe   we have just returned to the uk having spent   nights in new york at the new yorker hotel  prior to the trip we were apprehensive having read some negative reviews but we needn t have worried  on arrival the check in staff were efficient  getting us up the line quickly  we were  we often stay at the new yorker hotel and we always enjoy this beautiful hotel and its location close to everything in manhattan  the staff is always professional  helpful and courteous and the hotel itself has many amenities so that you don t even have to leave it  it has  this is our second stay at this hotel  and it will become our future hotel on our visits to new york  staff are professional and helpful  the room was clean and comfortable  though small  we weren t in it except to sleep  just returned from a   night stay  as everyone mentions  location is fantastic  close to time square  and penn subway station on   th  also less than   min walk to port authority bus station on  th ave  room  on floor     was dated  as was every area we were in  corridors etc   we stayed here for   nights  the hotel is in a lovely building in a great location   right near madison square gardens and penn station  we stayed at this hotel as we found a great deal on love holidays that we couldn t turn down and it did the job for what we needed it for   from the time you pull up to the new yorker    it is service with a smile  everyone is friendly and very helpful  the rooms are pleasant and housekeeping is always close by for assistance  to me  the showers are the best part of the room  strong  forceful  hot and relaxing  arrived here on       was a bit dubious as read some reviews  but we needn t have worried  amazing hotel   yeah maybe a little dated but this adds to its charm  friendly staff  couldn t do enough for us  tick tock is amazing they do the best breakfasts an dinners  not too  excellent location beautiful room wonderful helpful staff i can definitely recommend this hotel my room was spacious and comfortable the bed was extremely comfortable i was able to walk from penn station right to the hotel without any trouble dining options in the hotel are  we arrived in nyc via amtrak  penn station  the hotel was a short walk from the station  since the room was not ready when we arrived we were able to check our bags for a small fee  we were right down the street from the empire state building and within a    minute walk to  stayed at the new yorker in february for a   night break to new york  room was quite small but was offered an upgrade on arrival  but felt as we would only spend time in the room to sleep it was not worth the extra money  we were very surprised how close the hotel was to  it s a okay hotel for the price  lots of hidden fees  room are cheap but you have resort fee        then a deposit of      rooms are mediocre  our room door look like someone tried to break in the air in room was terrible didn t get cool until morning  iron was broke and tub and  pros  great location  close to a bunch of nice restaurants and entertainment cold silent air conditioner very comfy bed  coming from goldie locks  this is a big deal  very good food at the conference nice banquet rooms plenty of hot water shower caps and hair ties are included  i attended a four day convention at this property  there is a central newer building complex with hotel services  two restaurants anchoring each end of a long connected series of seach with bars and a whole wing of conference meeting facilities  the motel rooms are in separated  my second year here and things are over all much improved  i hosted a prearranged lunch for    of my colleagues and i want to express appreciation to the on property restaurant gatorville manager on duty  marilyn rodriguez  our food was ready and the section was set up for us  we booked in here for   nights whilst in florida  we were in block   to begin with and the room was filthy with stains on the seating and walls  we asked to be moved to block   and were moved to another room which we initially thought was better  but on closer inspection we  fantastic location  rooms a little aged but very clean and comfortable  all the staff we encountered where very helpful and courteous   this is our second stay at this resort hotel  i would highly recommend it  many thanks wyndham for making our stay a pleasure  rooms dirty and unserviceable noisy air on  you can hear everything he next door neighbours are saying through the bathroom vent  one of the large pools is mouldy and poorly maintained  staff at breakfast are outstanding and the only asset to this hotel  we had a great weekend trip  good food  room was clean  pool and bar area was awesome  would have liked for the room to have bigger bed options but i guess we booked later than usual so they were not available the standard   double bed is small for   people  my niece slept on the floor  but the bed itself is very comfortable as long as only one person sleeps on it  the resort fee is high  and the     per night for room service should be an option  at least if you don t order meals the  stayed at hotel for business conference      plus attendees  room on first look was hot  called guest services and was told how to operate the thermostat  the room would never cool below    degrees  even while set at    degrees or less  front desk was informed  the room   spent five nights here and could not fault it  rooms are small but very clean and the shower and bath a godsend in the cold weather  staff are helpful and it s a relaxed atmosphere in lobby  great location opposite madison sq garden  definitely recommend  lovely hotel we was upgraded to a room with a great view corner room   window looks out to madison square garden the other window up to the empire state building room was clean small but was only a base most of the staff are very rude and abrupt especially the security who  small rooms  great location  no hot water to shower in the morning  clean property  friendly staff  price was a bit higher than other hotels but the location is great  went to a hockey game at msg very convenient  close and great food nearby  booked via travel rupublic for   nights  it does state on web site that there is a resort fee to be paid at the hotel but after researching this and reading previous reviews this seemed to be optional based on services used  this fee is not optional  the services you are paying  this hotel was perfect for our stay  with the room overlooking the hudson river and a nicely sized room  the location of the hotel was also great with it only being a few blocks from times square and alain on the same street as the empire state building  the rest of manhattan  i stayed here september   th just for one night  the room was good it could have been updated a bit  the hardwood floors were alright  it kept the floors very cool throughout the day  the hotel is very spacious  they were alot of buildings to stay in throughout the resort    stayed for    nights aug sep with my family  after reading some of the bad reviews on here i was scared about what i would find but was pleasantly surprised  yes the rooms are dated but clean  the location was fantastic  able to walk to a variety of restaurants and shops  drive  room price was decent but the quality of the room sucked   hotel is in desperate need of an update   walls were so paper thin that i could hear the people nextdoor s conversations and the people above me having sex   room service left the dirty dishes outside one of the doors  here for a work conference  this is a great location  plenty of restaurants and activities within walking distance  hotel is spread out in multiple buildings  conference area is nice  i wouldn t mind returning during my annual family vacation  short distance to theme parks and  well from the start our door did not lock properly and got locked in room  there where pubic hairs and hairs around the bath and toilet when we first arrived  on the second day our door was left open by the maid  all day  through faulty door   we had to get the room fumigated  the new yorker is probably the best hotel i ve ever stayed in  every interaction with staff was great  particularly the wonderful lady who checked us in and made every endeavour to make our special trip even more special  even the people that checked our room keys for security  arrived from england having already been informed by my brother in law who had stayed at the wyndham that i might find the room not that big  but that it had not dampened his time at the hotel  he had pointed out that it was more than adequate for his stay  when booking in we  on arrival we were greeted by two lovely ladies who offered us an upgrade to larger rooms with two double beds  tv  tea   coffee making machine  two wardrobes  good bathroom  great shower   bathrobes   hairdryer  there were   ladies in our party so good facilities for two  fabulous hotel in the heart of manhattan   great for getting around new york with everything so close   the hotel is great lovely clean rooms    staff sometimes seem a little abrupt but i think that s a new york thing    overall recommend to all we came to new york   th february for   nights staying at the new yorker hotel on  th avenue  the hotel is really good  definitely check about paying resort tax  this is for amenities you may not use  wifi in the rooms  gym etc  our room was small but comfy  slept like a log in  very central and across from madison square gardens  tic tic dinner which has a entrance from lobby was great for breakfast  and staff very warm and friendly  room we were in was small but was ok   very retro but all mod cons were there  the hotel is in a great location  to the right is penn station  over the road are subway lines and about a    minute walk to the left up  th and across   nd is times square  it had the advantage of   on site restaurants in the building offering diner style to fine dining  just  stayed here for   nights and although the room was small  it was ok for the time we spent in there  a coffee maker would have been beneficial  its location was great for exploring new york  walking distance to lots of great places  arrived on   th feb    rooms for   people  to be told that they did not have a room for me and my daughter  after a long flight  i was so worried  they said travel bag had cancelled   of the rooms  they decided to put me and my daughter in a suite  with a fabulous view of the  stayed here for   nights last month  great hotel with very helpful staff  bedroom was on the small side but very comfortable and clean  only in it to sleep anyway  great location with subways and trains close by to go anywhere  the diner ticktock was excellent too  can t wait to  our room didn t have even basic cable and the room never got cold at night  we tried to see if it was the box that was not plugged but then we just realized that no it just didn t even have cable on the tv  visited for   weeks from  rd september to   th  have been to florida a fair amount of times and always stay here  emailed prior to arriving to be asked to be put into a room with an interior corrider as i feel these are better rooms and this was no problem  location is second to  only travelled a short distance for a one night get away but it was very nice  loved the environment once we found it  a bit confusing getting into the property  we ate outside to save a little on food  resort food and beverage prices are just that   resort prices   staff was  wanted a room w a balcony and called wyndham     reservation number  this was a same day reservation so i was desperate  boy do i regret it  the hallways were poorly lit and had a stale smell  i usually look at tripadvisor reviews but because of the lack of time i didn t  if i  was concerned after reading reviews but was presently surprised   stayed for a week on  th september   great hotel in excellent shape location near to shops and local amenities  hotel reception were very helpful and buffet breakfast at gatorville restaurant was good although  our first time to new york staying in the new yorker and certainly won t be our last  perfect central location  right next to penn station  port authority and short walk from times square  an old  established  iconic new york hotel  room very comfortable and clean  friendly and  the staff was very friendly  the location was perfect  just across from penn station msg  the rooms were dated and tiny  but clean  the walls were thin and you could hear the people around you  it was perfectly fine for my fianc  and i who were just staying for a night after the  staff was very nice   helpful  especially the man at the desk when we checked in very late  offered us late check out which was most appreciated  hotel room was clean  comfortable   very convenient to penn station   empire state building  bathroom a little dated   cracked tiles  there is a charge for early check in  when checked out charge for holding your suitcases prior to leaving the hotel  no tea and coffee facilities  cheaper to buy a kettle and some cups    which we did     booked a standard room with queen bed  assuming my friend and i had a bed  we stayed for   nights during half term  upon arrival check in was very smooth and we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite with amazing views of the empire state building  i found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful and in particular i am very gtrateful to a  wow  just returned from a wonderful stay at the new yorker  wyndham with my sister and my daughters  as a travel writer  i have travelled extensively  and i must say this hotel was top notch  the service was wonderful  the view stunning  the location perfect  special mention  we had an executive view double room  we were told when we booked that these rooms had undergone a complete renovation  that was very questionable  the shower leaked all over the floor  we put towels down to soak up the water  the sink was so small you couldn t turn the  great hotel   literally opposite penn station  can see it across the street if you come out at  th avenue  check in swift and and friendly  lobby really nice  art deco with a really cool vibe  our room was on the   th floor  brilliant view of madison square garden  and the  this was my first time visiting new york along with   other friend and this hotel and hospitality was incredibly disappointing  months before arriving  we had requested two twin beds  but when we arrived in reception  we were informed that if we wanted twin beds it would cost  the new yorker is in a great location right next to penn station  making going to and from jfk airport very easy via subway or lirr  it is also well placed for the tourist sights and of course all the great shopping  we ha a lovely double room on the   th floor with twin double  i have stayed in this hotel on several occasions over the past few years while attending afo  i don t think i have ever had a truly bad experience here  rooms have nice decor and are very modern looking  the hotel has two pools which is nice  we requested a bottom floor room  i stayed for   days for a microsoft conference  overall  my experience was very poor  the hot water was broken for an entire day so i couldn t have a hot shower in my room that day  the wifi in my room stopped working for the last three days  and it wasn t fixed after i reported  stayed   nights for my daughters wedding  once again didn t disappoint  this is our second visit  the room we we originally allocated had a saggy bed and very noisy air con  after one night we asked for a new mattress and for the air on to be looked at  we were moved to another  hotel grounds were nice  rooms small  but clean and well serviced  staff very friendly and helpful  worked well for my stay while attending a conference at the occc  on my last day i spent two hours in their gatorville restaurant after checking out  waiting until i needed to  stayed a few years ago and has definitely declined since our last stay very expensive and the breakfast at the pool bar was awful cold and not very appetising and staff were very grumpy think they prefer conference people to holiday makers good hotel  central location  rooms reasonably clean  comfortable beds  would stay again close  walking distance to everywhere  quite rooms  enjoyed my stay            nice view from the window   you can see anew york city as others have mentioned  this hotel is in an ideal mid town location  but we found our room to be disappointingly small and in need of updating    tired  being an apt description  we arrived late evening after a flight delay and the receptionist made a show of searching on his  we booked the new yorker based on the location that it had  right on the  th avenue  next to madison square garden  perfect location and great area to be in  the front desk team was great and very helpful  same as the concierge  that helped us with maps and booking an airport  recently stayed here on a five night trip with my husband as a birthday treat  thanks to jose for upgrading us to a suite with amazing views  great location for exploring nyc and that s exactly what we done  i would recommend this hotel as nothing was too much bother  came to this hotel for my stay in nyc this week  as we were going to see elton john at madison square garden on march  th  couldn t ask for this hotel to be more perfectly located  as we came in on the train from new jersey  and penn station is a very short walk away  was also  from the moment we arrived check in smooth and efficient  the hotel is old charm from top to bottom  staff very helpful and rooms very comfortable  walking around new york is easy from the perfect location and will stay here again if i return  first class    this is my favorite ny hotel  location  atmosphere  friendly staff  everything  sure  it s not a luxury hotel but that s really not the point  but this time i was disappointed  i took my    year old son  first time in ny  and requested and paid for a room with a view of the  this was our first time in new york and straight away found the staff very helpful  the hotel itself is ideally situated for madison square gardens and the empire state building  there s lots of staff around the lobby more than willing to help you  the rooms are clean and  it was art deco but not modern  nothing was kept up with the diner  and italian restaurant are good just not good customer service  i asked for a cot with pillows and a blanket and was denied   so offensive i have stayed in the new yorker each time i ve come to the city for business and have found the staff to be friendly and accommodating and the room to be consistent  the price is reasonable for the location  i will continue to use them every time i travel to nyc  when i go to nyc i always stay at the new yorker because of its location and value  the rooms are always clean and the views amazing  the staff is always attentive to your needs  we will be back in a few weeks  used my wyndham points for two nights and purchased two more nights  notified front desk at checkin and had a seamless transition between to two reservations  keeping the same room  we found our room in excellent condition  standard room was a bit small but not enough to  nice place to stay and close to the madison square gardens and many other fun places to visit  penn station is right across the street and that s very convenient  clean rooms and nice choices for food and drink at the hotel  the staff were all nice and helpful  the location is perfect for shopping and across the street from madison square gardens  our suite was very clean  comfortable and quite spacious  we all enjoyed the lovely lounge and the tic tock for anytime dinning was superb  the staff were super friendly and very  i ll start by saying i found absolutely nothing wrong with my stay  its an older hotel  with great location and a good value  its an older property  things are kept up but you can see the age on them  its clean but weathered  there s nothing fancy about this place  absolute amazing time staying at the new yorker from the easy professional check in from miguel who even upgraded us to   rd floor with a fantastic view of empire state building and madison square garden  staff all friendly and helpful lady in tick tick restaurant advised us  we stayed for   nights at the new yorker  room was super clean  a bit tight for   adults but only in room to sleep so it was fine  had requested high floor with a view and this was given to us  staff very nice  expect the bathroom to be small but has all the necessities    i would not recommend this hotel to anyone  especially when there are so many great choices available for accommodations in nyc  we stayed here for   days and it felt like an eternity  the first room we were placed in was extremely musty and the decor was very dated  i felt as  stayed at the new yorker for my first visit to nyc to see a concert at madison square gardens  great property and really affordable given its location to everything i wanted to do  make sure you check out the museum in the basement  i wandered across it by accident  the  we stayed for   nights and were very pleased with the room  it was simple but clean  as a visit to new york for us meant being out for most of the day this room was more than adequate  the bed was comfy  check in and out went smoothly  the location is perfect  lots within   rd time to the wyndham and it didn t disappoint  great rooms  comfortable bed and good amenities  pool is great although sadly was closed for last   days of our stay and when asked at reception when it would reopen was told it was open despite being coned off  great location   i stayed here for three nights and had to switch rooms everyday i was here  the first night we were assigned a room that had an adjoining door and we didn t know if who was next door  as we were about to go to sleep someone pushed up against the door and our adjoining door  this was our second visit the last being    years ago  how the place has changed  first class with good access to all theme parks and local restaurants well worth the    ticket on the i trolley  drinks are a bit on the dear side but it is a   star rating  staff are friendly and  an overall very pleasant stay for the   weeks our party of   were there  the hotel is excellently located for accessing the theme parks and has lots of great restaurants within a very short walk  rooms were a good size and decent standard  although the bathrooms were a bit  i mixed business and vacation with my stay at the wyndham orlando  i was there for a conference  the hotels rooms were ok if you are not planning to spend too much time in them  the conference portion was pretty good  i was impressed with the food and the meetings rooms were  we stayed for   nights in a suite on   th floor         the views were absolutely amazing  the bedroom windows views were onto the empire state building one way and the financial centre downtown  world trade centre the other way  for   days we loved every sunset and sunrise  the  very small room as expected  i had to hire a small fridge to store my medication  housekeeping very efficient and room was spotless  never tried the in house diner  the best thing about the hotel was the location next to the subway station  my wife cannot walk far so we used the  fantastic boutique hotel very central to macey s times square and penn station  we where there just prior to thanksgiving leaving the morning of thanksgiving  hotel is fantastic and nyc as always a pleasure to visit good price  but beware hidden charges    night stay incites a further      in facility fees  then you have to pay    dollars for your luggage to be looked after   so what s the facility fee for exactly   room are small but clean  the saving grace for me was john at the concierge  we stayed here for    days  i was disappointed at the lack of facilities available for guests  no coffee tea facilities   they wanted     per day for a drip filter     no kettle  no laundry service  it blew out our food budget tremendously as we couldn t prepare anything in  we stayed here for   weeks in october  on arrival we were given the card keys to our rooms in block     firstly the negatives   the corridors to the rooms are awful  dark and like a cheap motel  not a great first impression  the air con units need replacing  very loud and  stayed here this weekend for a family trip to universal  cost      for two nights despite a significantly better deal being booked online   be aware there are several state and resort taxes fees added which will add to price  free parking and wifi  gym onsite and two smallish  this hotel is massive   everything is so close by and convenient  the restaurant  gatorville  is really  really good and inexpensive  rasique  sure i m spelling it wrong was extremely nice  he drove us back and forth in the golf cart from building to building  veronica at the  i was hesitant to book this hotel due to prior experience with wyndham  the only reason i booked this hotel is because a colleague was also staying there  the guestroom was dusty and had a weird odor  there are no grab bars in the tub shower and the tub was slippery causing me  my fiance and i stayed here last december for his   th birthday trip  he s a bit of coaster fanatic so we did a quick weekend trip to orlando so he could visit busch tampa and sea world  we had a great trip and enjoyed the parks  our room at the wyndham orlando on int l drive  this may be close to the parks but dont let that fool you   shuttle service is virtually non existent so be prepared to uber or drive yourself  beds super uncomfortable  i can t stress that enough   so tired  still ants crawling up the wall blood splatters up the wall in the  this hotel says it is remodeled online but it is far from that   the bathrooms are dirty  the tubs are chipped and cracked  crack in the ceiling above the bed dropping plaster into the bed  the carpets are dirty the mattress was disgusting when i looked at it  the outside when  lobby was nicely renovated  but booked a renovated superior king room that was small  bathroom was very small and sliding doors barely worked  parking lots need maintenance  pool area could be updated  etc  i would not book again  while at airport i was able to book this property on my phone  which was one of the last places available  near my daughter condo  it was pet friendly which is good to know when you need to come back with your dog  clean double bed  with small fridge and coffee maker  full tub   party of   on a   week stay oct nov stayed in premium rooms in building    which is a short walk outside from the pool area gatorville reception   after booking we were very concerned at the amount of bad reviews we had read  i emailed the hotel who put our mind at ease  the room smelled musty on entrance and the fridge wasn t working  the fridge was fixed very quickly after notifying the front desk  they have excellent customer service  they just need to update their furniture and do something about the musty smell in the rooms  our family stayed at this beautiful hotel resort  we had lots of fun  it is very close to to the orlando outlet for excelent shopping  we recomend it  great pools  safe location  close to excelent restaurants we had a king bed room that had ample living space  we did encounter a problem with the door lock and the front desk manager was able to get it fixed quickly  the conference rooms were very nice and the food served during the conference breaks was good  this is my second or third time staying here  the grounds here are immaculate  the rooms are awesome  and the staff is the friendliest of any orlando hotel that i stay at  much to my surprise  even though i was only here for one night this trip  they secretly upgraded me to  we frequent orlando and usually stay at castle or reaidence inn  we decided to try wyndham  we arrived late  finding check in wasn t very clear  two employees directed us to the wrong location  one employee pointed to the conference center and it was like a maze to find check  history and efficiency ooze from this place  built in the heyday of deco architecture  the lobby retains elements that remind you of a bygone era  i last stayed here in       when the property was sorely in need of renovation  recent upgrades made by wyndom and other owners  stayed here for   nights week before christmas last year  this was our third time to new york but first time at this hotel  the location is great  we hardly got the subway to anywhere  the only place we got the subway was when we went further afield to natural history museum or  great hotel small rooms but you expect that in new york   great location    mins away from times square   mins away from empire state building and next door is the penn station for the subway  would definitely      recommend this hotel  the photos i put up are from our bedroom just returned from an amazing week in nyc  stayed at the new yorker for its great location and accessibility to everywhere   this is where the hotel scores really highly with penn station right next door and easy access uptown and downtown  hotel itself is iconic with some  this was my third visit to the newyorker and after comparing it with others  even higher end  i will only stay here  great location and the vibe of the busy hotel lobby is fabulous  it has such an old world newyork feel  rooms are small but what else do you expect in nyc but  the hotel isn t horrible but i wouldn t stay here again  it didn t really live up to my expectations of what i thought a wyndham property should be  the room decor is ok but has a dirty feeling  the outside appearance isn t pleasing and the room cleaning is sub par  we had to check out early because the room smelled like sewer and we couldn t take it anymore  this is more like a dirty motel  not a resort  the rooms are very old and it seems that they just don t take care of them  the blinds were dirty and the paint on the bathroom ceiling  we stayed a full week at this hotel recently and some issues came up  we requested an accessible room with a roll in shower  not a tub  but got a tub which wasn t correct but we made due because we wanted to get to our room  maid service in general was always late in the   it was so close to what we were there for            nothing  everything was great it was really clean with comfortable bed and quiet placy           nothing  rooms were quiet and large  beds were adequate   checkin was pleasant    free parking on premises           guess what  a fire alarm went off at   pm  no staff directing or any communications whatsover from beginning to end  no clear assembly point anywhere  and no staff knocking on doors to checking people what left the rooms  actually  aside from the reception staff on the phone  i never saw anyone else directing or assisting guests   after the fire brigade confirmed it was a false alarms and had left the alarm went off again with yet another false alarm  never got a note to explain nor an apology for the disruption on checkout   smelly carpets  old and old  needs a face lift badly   convenient location and excellent hotel for the modest price            i did not like that it is impossible to walk to the train station that is only few hundred meters away  it is not ecological that a shuttle bus needs several miles to reach that station   the location was excellent to td garden  as well as within walking distance to quincy market            it wasn t as clean or updated for the cost of the room  the hallways weren t vacuumed and the carpet in the room didn t seem clean   there is nothing to complain about the location   it s close to boudwin and charles station  the major tour spots on freedom trail are also within walking distance  my favorite part is jogging along charles river in the morning  which made me feel like living in boston  although the breakfast provided was too expensive for us  we made ourselves at home every morning at whole foods  which is just around the corner    there is a      gym at the second floor  the equipment is limited but you can still do some basic training in it            there is no microwave or electric kettle  which is inconvenient  especially for guests from china  who are generally used to drinking hot water      the check in time is another drawback   pm is too late   the location            the pricing  the parking and extra fees  charging for every little thing   the parking for the price you pay and no parking included  only    minutes from td garden             the room had no refrigerator or microwave  ran out of toilet paper and tissues in the middle of the night  cleaning and maintenance people just knocked then walked right in  didn t matter if you were changing or showering  then woke up to cockroaches in the room  worst         i ve ever spent   comfy beds  big rooms  friendly service            no breakfast supplied  no came too clean roon and no check bedroom  no refridgeretor and microwave  location           the parking fees were insanely high     i ended up paying     for parking there for    hours     that s not right  quiet rooms   very friendly staff   staff solved our issue quickly           bathroom pipes were broken in the first room we got   for the price of stay  definitely not worthy it   also it s around hospitals  so expect   usd to park  quiet environment  nice place to stay if you are very tired from long travel           filty carpet  noisy aircon i have to on a noisier fan as the cold air from the ventilation does not circulate well inside the room   the wyndham grand is in the best location in clearwater beach  the hotel is very attractive and well maintained  the staff was highly accommodating and the one problem we did have  was taken care of with a minimum of difficulty  the front desk staff could not have been better             i have no complaints   location was perfect for td garden event  staff was friendly and courteous            booked a room with   beds and only got one with a roll away  not too comfortable     toilet was backed up and had to call for help late at night  problem was resolved promptly   the location was great           i didn t like that there wasn t a continental breakfast  for the value of the room  the hotel needs breakfast   i understand that there is a restuarant and a cafe  if that s the case  then a meal credit should he given to the customers   thank you everything was good  this hotel needs a upgrade   feel cleaning  location  car service  access to restaurants  shops           nothing really  it was a good experience  staff were nice           hotel was quite shabby  it needs a makeover  we had to ask to move into a better room twice  eventually was given a junior sweet which wasnt too bad  all rooms have a big gap at the bottom of the door   nothing           aircon was half broken and too noisy to be on while sleeping  cleanliness of the sheets dubious  everything old and musty  forgot my kindle in the sheets    i called several times  left voicemails  sent emails  never got a reply   avoid this place at all costs   the hotel was in a good location and the staff were accommodating  the room was nice  though small  and clean            the pool was really cold  almost too cold to go in  we had our room upgraded from a regular to executive and it was tiny  myself and a friend thought it would be bigger   good location  boston is smaller than i thought  could walk anywhere  comfortable place  clean            no concierge  desk staff did not have good input or where to go or where to eat   bed was nice comfortable   lot quieter than expected  friendly staff            no hot tub   great location within easy walk of downtown  whole foods out the back door  perfect if you need access to mgh           rundown  not a good restaurant  area not exciting at all  nothing much just ordinary hotel           the double queen was very small  the room was dirty  the whole hotel was not decently clean  i liked the location and shuttle service to the airport           the phone in our room didn t work  the air conditioner leaked a lot of water on the floor  i ate in the restaurant downstairs and found a hair in my food    room was an extremely long way from a very  very slow elevator   the place and the staff is very nice            the price of the bedroom for one night is very expensive   just terrible  they didn t have a lifeguard for the pool so it was closed for several hours until they found one  pool is in poor condition certainly not like their photos  hotel old  room had mildew smell too many better cooler hipper hotels in boston  very disappointed with this place           see above  location            bar   drinks were far to expensive  the quietness            room too small  no hot water   the room itself was clean and put together           the wifi connection was consistently very bad and unusable  the water in the bathroom was never hot  only lukewarm at the hottest setting both at night and in the morning   i m always great here  good location near red line and walking distance to all sites  large comfortable rooms            ambulance can by noisy as the hotel is near the hospital  pool is a little basic and doesn t open until      am   as we headed closer to property we noticed the price go down considerably on booking com   we had some struggles resolving the manner  kipp added in that help  he also gave us a beautiful room with a nice view as it was our    year anniversary   august         thank you kipp  everything was old  location            hallway and property maintenance  example garden water was leaking all day and night in the front of property and enterance to restaurants and car park  near airport  free shuttle bus  free wifi  good price            air conditioner is noisy   free shuttle service is good  it was hot in hallways and elevators  the hotel entrance dirty and has a stale smell            the environment could do with upgrade and repairs  i enjoyed my lunch downstairs at the cafe             pillows were small  and too soft   pretty standard hotel  comfortable beds and spacious room            bathroom was a little small  at check in  staff seemed a little overwhelmed and stressed out  gym was tiny and overheated  common space in the lobby can get a little crowded  a little overpriced  but so are pretty much all hotels in boston   the property is       min away from multiple locations such as boston common  downtown crossing  quincy market  and is also   mins away from the train station  there s also a convenient store and a wholefoods market at the back with easy access    we were very comfortable with everything else in the hotel   the place           nothing  clean   friendly staff   and very accommodating           pool area needs to be tidy up at the end of the day   room should ve been a bit bigger  the mattresses are really old  could feel the springs   good location and large room    good dining facilities in the hotel also food that you had a cvs store and while leg foods so close           toilet paper dispenser should not be behind the toilet as it is too hard to reach   the room was perfect  great view of the mountains  the entire staff was great            the mandatory valet parking   the bed was very good for sleep and clean  love it   close to the airport           there was not water for room coffe  everything  everything else was great  staff was helpful  food and drinks good with a reasonable price  if you re looking for           the hot tub was takrn over by little children jumping in and out with swimmies on with no adult supervision   friendly staff  great location   outdoor pool and loungers were great           room wasn t ready at time they told us to come back for  but received complimentary breakfast for   the following morning   feces in pool  couldn t use pool  main reason we booked there   i stayed because my flight was cancelled till morning and i needed a place near the airport   so i found one with a nice pool i could swim in   cafe in lobby is    hours  hurray  i was to take the shuttle at        free airport shuttle every half hour   a convenience store  cafe  bar  and restaurant            i was in a room with an adjoining door to the next room  the door was paper thin and there were loud men in the next room who talked very loudly late at night  they also had their phone on the bedside table right on the other side of the door  and it beeped all night  paper thin door   ask for one without and adjoining door   also i think my washroom was right under the hvac on the roof  so it was very loud and shaking  luckily that sound didn t carry out of the bathroom though  new york is an expensive place to visit  if your flight is via newark  consider basing yourself at this clean and comfortable hotel  for me it provided good value for money  and the free    hour shuttle to   from the airport allowed easy access to nj transit services to nyc            there are no walking routes to the airport or to any train station  that s no fault of the hotel  just a downside of being located in such a car based city   the carpets were really dirty  as were the walls and ceilings  the ceiling tiles were all loose and because there was a storm they were flapping in the wind all night  we arrived and there were no towels in the bathroom  i imagine this place was nice about    years ago  but it really needs a renovation  if i paid     i d understand  but the night we stayed the rate was        very good location    helpful staff members   food and service were excellent            should have been free for the room price  front staff did not indicate it was not included with price of room   location  service  pool  staff  great rooms  great service  great value   everything            nothing   thought alcohol  beer prices way over the top considering tip     a beer really     then option should be for vallet parking     plus tip per day  it s location           air conditioning and in room ventilation      mins walk to most attractions            next to hospital  the room is dated   good location           staff were just alright  rooms seemed dated  friendly staff  comfortable room and great swimming pool  i didn t like the room you give us to    floor when we arrived  in the resa  we said that we want a room on the first or second floor because one person didn t take the elevator   the staff is friendly and helpful  the facility is worn out  very cramped bathroom  beat up furniture in room  broken coffee maker and hairdryer  it was clean  excellent location for people with business at mass general or for sightseeing  we cut off a few nights at the end of our stay within the grace period  to make changes  however our room rate went up considerably and we did not realize it  be sure to check your receipt if you make any changes to your reservation   everything from top to bottom was great  the location is good  room is decent  check in was easy and fast  staff was ok             thankfully the windows could open cause the air quality was bad  probably from old carpets  very slow elevator  price was too much for the quality  it s hard to get to  unless you are familiar with newark international airport and it s confusing highway system   housekeeping staff           restaurant com  the property was relatively clean  a little outdated  we never had a problem with the shower water was always warm  the location was very good  we walked everywhere  averaging about    miles per day  the cost was significantly cheaper than all other hotels in then vicinity  which was our main reason for choosing it             the beds were awful  very uncomfortable  we woke up with back pain everyday  the rooms do not come with a refrigerator  i even requested one stating i d pay extra  and i still didn t get one  the pool is cold  not heated  even on hot days it was uncomfortably cold  the bar is insanely expensive      for a mixed drink  and it was terrible  go somewhere else   the front desk receptionist  bariah  was informative  helpful  polite and made our overall stay at wyndham gardens enjoyable  it was a joy to see that the pool and the pool area was thoroughly cleaned every morning  our room was comfortable and clean  the staff was friendly            at the restaurant that is attached to the hotel  the starlight  the waitress  whom we later found out to be one of the managers there  attached on a service charge to our breakfast bill  the previous day we had also had breakfast there and there was no service charge  although as we customarily do  we left a tip  when we asked her what the service charge was for  she said   if you dine in  you receive a service charge  but if you order out you don t receive a service charge  this service charge was not added on to any of our other receipts that we attained when dining there during our stay  we ate at the restaurant four times and did not receive a service charge until this day  also  with my breakfast i had forgotten to ask for wheat bread instead of white bread  when i asked her for the wheat bread  after receiving an eye roll from her  she brought me what requested  although i don t mind being charged the tip in advance  i felt that this practice should have been consistent so that it is understood that only some select visitors are tagged with a service charge being that we dined in and did not order out  we should not have been charged a service charge   we loved the location of the hotel            we were dissatisfied with the property and the room for the price we paid  i expected much more and would recommend renovating   location  pool and friendly staff           the beds were very uncomfortable   way too hard      breakfast buffet was too expensive  the bathtub was also not clean unfortunately  staff was pleasant  friendly and helpful           restaurant prices are way too high especially with children   great location clean room and great shower            nothing  the food was okay but very expensive            i paid for a non smoking room and the room smell like cigarettes   no cover  sheets for the pull out couch  the shower and tub was dirty with hair in it   the lobby was beautiful  the pillows on the bed was plentiful and comfortable  i was glad there was an iron and ironboard in the room  i was glad to have a desk in the room  the furniture was nice  plenty of parking             the room smelled bad when i walked in  had to spray the room down  the ac was very loud  there was no remote in the room for the tv but they sent one up when called  the bathroom wasn t clean enough  the sink was cracked  the towel rack was barely hanging on the makeshift drywall that needed replacement  some of the titles in the ceiling in the bathroom shower area needed cleaning  there was only one wash cloth in the room  the headboard wasn t secure to the wall  the bed was very uncomfortable   the kitchen included new pots and pans  sharp knives  nice appliances  we loved the linens  the access to washers and dryers  the staff was just wonderful always eager to help us and make our stay the best  very nice game room  fresh apples and cookies are available for the guests to enjoy            i really do not like  as a guest already paying the hotel fees  having to pay the additional     a day to park  for the entire hotel  there was only one bbq  a very good one  but still just the one   the air conditioner stopped working our last night and maintenance was not able to fix it  easy airport transfer            very outdated  difficult location unless you truly are just looking for an overnight airport stay   not much            the property is in very bad condition  is dirty  unclean and in general terms the management is not paying attention  regardless of the price  please go somewhere else  we left after   hrs   there is so much good to say about this property it would take a short book  from the valet to the valet  basically the entire stay  the service was impeccable  but i would be remiss if i did not single out the outstanding service from the desk clerk who checked us in  the property itself is gorgeous and spotless and we will be returning  thank you so much            n a  location is awesome  we were able to watch the  th of july fireworks from our hotel room  what a show    we were able to walk around downtown and stop by the hotel if needed            parking your car is expensive  however  it is boston  great walking city   cost           older in need of updates  shower was not goo  very good emplacement to visit boston           no fridge in the room in july   i was traveling with friends and was able to get a room across the hall from them           everything was good   clean  comfortable  good location  free airport shuttle             old fashion look  breakfast not included in the price  no coffee desk at the lobby   everything  the hotel is in the middle of nowhere but handy to the airport           i forgot my swimmers  the bed  pool was dirty  location            the coffee maker in my room was very dirty   the design of the suites was amazing  the staff was courteous  huge shout out to evan  he did a top notch job  ralph was very kind at check in as well  the suites were just gorgeous   the facilities were well thought out  if ever i am back in colorado  then this hotel will be my first choice             the valet parking   it is a beautiful hotel in a great location            i wasn t a fan of the coffee  maybe provide a flavored creamer   the convenient store in the lobby  the parking  the housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful            mold in the shower and on the shower curtain  locked out of the room twice  key card did not work  i would have benefited from a refrigerator and microwave in the room  no free breakfast  available for tour groups only   proximity to airport only           very unkempt and unpleasant smell  that place needs a serious renovation  will never stay there again till things change   the service was great  surpassed expectations  felt so welcomed and appreciated as a guest            that i only has two days     location was great  pool was ok  staff was friendly            could hear elevators all nite from our room   the room was spacious and comfortable  we enjoyed our stay  will definitely visit again   locarion           hotel seemed expensive for what it offered   the bathrooms by the front lobby where really disgusting  there where no coffee or tea options in the lobby for people to have access to  it really seemed this hotel is all about making money  the room however was clean and the housekeeping staff where very nice    the staff at the front lobby besides one older woman  where very rude  they wanted to charge us    a piece for seltzer water which was ridiculous just for water  we did love the pool and location  otherwise the other things could really improve on customer service   location           dirty and old  the restaurant            not much options if restaurant outside  the restaurant is a little bit expensive  staff  cleanliness  price  very tough front desk meeting us at night            no refrigerator available or even microwave  spacious modern hotel  well located  walking distance to the tourist highlights   price for parking  staff food pool and the location of the holtel is great close to nyny hoboken airport u can be in any of these places in    min or less              could use an update on the furniture and bathroom in the room needs a little work  close to the airport  shuttle between the airport and the hotel every    min   h           the ac was broken  bed is not very comfortable  no microwave  it was in a great location             our key never worked at our room  and it seemed overpriced  also i was over charged and no one could seem to explain why that took place   the staff was responsive  friendly and very helpful  the accommodations were lovely and incredibly clean            paying daily for the valet parking in addition to the room costs   good location  friendly staff and good service  also close to vail and the entire valley   close proximity to the airport  friendly staff           almost everything   the room smelt  it was damp  puddle of water leaking from the aircon   dirty  squished bugs on walls   no working aircon  airport transfer was really late collecting us from the airport  after an already delayed and cancelled flight  food from restaurant wasn t great  wouldn t even give this a   star  and wasn t cheap either   location of hotel to everything clearwayer had to offer could not be better            digital thermostat light was very bright and lit up room at night making sleeping challenging  thermostat could be in a better location  small pool for a resort of this caliber   friendly staff  nice bar            bathtub had no safety mats  when stepping in the tub  it was slippery   the breakfast buffet was too expensive   excellent location  close to t stop  coffee shops             our rooms were next to the elevator and it was noisy  had a hard time sleeping   proximity to the aiport             very little food options   old infrastructure  no response to the pre check in messages sent  all the extra soft fluffy pillows            a very large area of the carpet from the window to the desk was soaking wet  not as if someone spilled something but like a large leak somewhere should be checked out   it was first class but at      a night i expected a little more  location was good and as centrally as advertised            windows don t open  air conditioning loud unable to set a good temperature  carpets in room old tatty and dirty sorry  this certainly wasn t    hotel and not worth about     per night  no mini bar  fridge in room   the breakfast at the hotel was good and the service and price were also good and the coffee at the lobby cafe was also very good           my son brought a salad from the cafe in the loby and it was not any good   but when he tool it back down there they did give him his money back with no problems  close to the airport           dirty bathroom floor and wall tiles broken grouting missing  the staff was helpful and amazing            the smell of mold in the hallways and the link ac in my room  that made my carpet wet  everything and staff made us feel important  while celebrating our   th anniversary            nothing  bathroom was not locked  shower was broken  it was way too expensive for this quality            very good location and clean  overall not much stuff there and we were expecting more   good location           better communication between staff  rooms were elegant and beautiful  incredibly comfortable beds  the hot tub was amazing           n a  clean  gorgeous and very accommodating           everything was perfect  nothing to complain about and expectations were exceeded  there is a big roach in the lobby and fresh spit on the elevator door and the elevator was filthy  i was afraid to walk on the rugs in the room everything smelled like must  the place is old and unkempt and worn out  the hallways were not clearn   bellman anthony was so kind and welcoming to all of us  my   yr old son really thought he was nice            the pool umbrellas could have been bolted to the base to prevent flying off during wind gusts  my son almost got hit by a flying umbrella  scared me  location was amazing            having to pay daily fee of     for valet                        very friendly and helpful staff  bed was great            one of the front desk ladies does not like her job   location is ok  close to starbucks             our room had an odor when we checked in  the room wasn t particularly clean either  when i retrieved my car from the valet  there was damage to the rear bumper   great location  location to mgh           we were not told that a     incidental charge would be put on our credit card and not refunded for      business days   didn t like that i was booked into a wheelchair accessible room and when mentioned it to front desk they never offered to accommodate me with another room  don t you request these rooms  there must have been a shortage of wash cloths and hand towels  especially my last night i had to use wash cloths i picked up at walmart   thought i was in jamaica when every morning i had to wait for the hot water in shower at least    minutes before it got hot   good location           the bed was old and i woke up each morning with a sore back  that shouldn t happen for over      a night   location and very clean  room service for

stocked with coffee pot  coffee  tea  etc  the bed was comfy and nicely made  we would definitely stay here any time we were traveling thought this airport              a little aged  staff           air condition was hot  the room where i stayed was relatively large and modern  although the bathroom is small  the location is relatively convenient  not far from haymarket            it is not possible to open the window even a bit to get some fresh air  the bathroom had shower but no tub  at check in the person at the counter wasn t very friendly  pool wasn t crowded  the little coffee bar

desk wasn t very nice  the pool was cold   the one bedroom is a spacious unit with a full kitchen and luxurious bathroom  the concierge  michael  went above and beyond             the hotel should offer daily room service as an option at check in  the bellhop  luis  never brought up extra shampoo like he promised at check in   very old and not so clean furniture in reception and rooms hotel needs renovation   near to airport  round the clock shuttle to airport           no coffee in the room  bed           cystomer service was unprofessional disrespectful and degrading  decent breakfast buffet  a bit pricey  very nice wait staff            over priced room and food   the location is very good  close to beacon hill              a room is not so clean and new as i thought  the air conditioner was old and all the room needs to be renovated   great location for exploring the area   hotel was very clean and very comfortable beds    loved the treats in the foyer and the breakfast was very well stocked           nothing   great for a one night stop over near the airport  hmm  the proximity to the airport  on time shuttle service  and the shuttle drivers            there was an old lady working at the receptionist desk  she was quite rude  at times shouting at the guests  she should retire forthwith   the staff were all so friendly  frank  the chef at the buffet bar was over the top in meeting our needs    of us eat gluten free  after the first day of ordering a more specialized array of foods  he would see us the following mornings and have the gluten free items cooking before we got to the counter to order  he even surprised us with special foods as well  it absolutely made the entire stay better than we could have imagined            it would have been nice if the towel counter st the pool was open the whole time  it rained on and off alot during our stay  so we spent all of our time at the beach  there were a few times we were unable to acquire towels for the beach   the internet barely worked or didn t work  the location was great            the bed was the most uncomfortable bed i have ever been in   we were early for check in and the staff was very accommodating  we were able to check in several hours before the check in time   staff  free coffee  location and activities            the beds were smaller than we thought and not very comfortable

things there was very pricey      read more   read less i really liked this hotel and will probably book there again  amenities are awesome  overall hotel is very nice  the reason i reviewed as i did was because when we arrived  the hotel staff told us that they overbooked and we were going to have to be moved from room to room in the middle of our stay  with children  that sucks  but we didn t have a choice  we booked so long in advance there was no way another hotel would be the same price and the area was pretty sold out  so we bit the bullet  but the next morning we went downstairs and the staff at the counter had no idea what we were talking about  then informed us that there were no other rooms to move us to  which is great  it was just an inconvenience we had to stay packed for a day thinking we d be moving rooms and then when addressed no one knew what we were talking about  also  breakfast at the summit restaurant in the same parking lot  we got the continental and it was just fruit and a fruit pastry  i paid for a different breakfast but it was ridiculously priced  if we weren t staying at the hotel  two bowls of fruit  two pastries  two plates of biscuits and gravy

stay i messaged the hotel about any additions for the birthday that if they added i would pay for in advance and appreciate  none of that happened  upon check in the front desk woman was coarse and seemed overworked  i had questions about the amenities and she quickly averted the topic  the bartenders in the lobby were nice but it seemed that everyone was from another country that s all they talked about   that s fine with me but it became noticably worse when they were arriving to work visibly hung over      the  resort  is fine  at check in we were handed a map that let us know where everything was  there was a quiet pool on that map that we were looking forward to  however the reality is that it was unmonitored and often over run by kids and louder adults  the same with the hot

we were only comfortable   of the   nights we stayed in this hotel  i rented two rooms  both were changed day   due to cold showers the prior two nights  then the hot water in the entire hotel went

another cold shower  and left in the morning  when we returned  the bed had water on it dripping from the air conditioner vent and the ac was not working correctly  since it couldn t be fixed  all furniture was moved to the side out of the drip area which meant i couldn t sit on the bed without hitting my head on a light  and no ac for that evening  the next day they lied again saying it had been fixed  i had to call for them to move the furniture back and then looked up to see more water on the vent  we pushed the furniture over ourselves and slept like that the rest of our stay  without the ac working properly  after talking to every single manager and getting nowhere i had to wait two hours one morning day   to speak to the director of operations who all but accused me of lying

has been less than ideal  i gave them the benefit of the doubt last time and thought maybe we had the same housekeeper every time and they were just having some bad days but it happened this trip too  the tile floors were not cleaned during our stay and we had two people with long hair  the tub did not seem to get cleaned because a rusty stain started appearing from the dripping however i think they did try because two days when we came back for the evening  the tub was plugged and water was standing in it  we had the garden view on our other trips and this time we were stuck in the back by the employee parking  we missed the view but thought maybe it would be quieter since less people were walking past  etc  but the car alarms all night made up for it  the hotel room wasn t showing too

should have been a shuttle bus to universal studios from the resort as well as to disney  the shuttle buses eliminate the costly expense of parking        i ordered room service two of the nights that we stayed and i was under the impression the charges were take from my account at the time the food was delivered but when i checked out  i was given the bill for room service and other charges  i was not given the option of having it debited from credit card and i would have preferred that to having more charges added to my already expensive bill   maybe i misunderstood but i thought when i booked the trip through expedia that everything except resort fees were paid for but when i checked in i was charged another      which was refunded but i was not prepared for that  i could have budgeted a little better for the trip    nevertheless  it was taken care of  my next trip will be a planned a little better and i will stay somewhere a little less expensive and somewhere that provides

didn t work which was strange  so besides the ac  the bathroom fan  and the semi out of date rooms  the hotel is nice  no signs in the lobby tho for check in etc  the pool was great  the gatorville restaurant was our go to for breakfast because everything was already prepared and not expensive at all  the fitness center was tiny  not sufficient for a leg or back workout  and the wifi in our room

wouldn t flush  the safe was not working and the hotel room looked like a dump  it didn t look like what i had reserved  i called front desk to speak to the manager and we switched our room to another

come back to pick up our rooms keys   th floor in the tower  we fall asleep and not an hour later we keep hearing loud girls in the hall slamming doors  singing  and one point  music  it went on the

first  let me start off by saying that i have never liked this cheap looking hotel  i was there in       and my keycard kept deactivating on its own  now  in       it did it again  i see you haven t upgraded  but this is not about the keycard  this is about your silly  facility fee   exactly  what facilities did i use    the toilet  i was under the impression that that was covered in the regular hotel fee  we got no complimentary coffee  no hair dryer in our room  no complimentary breakfast in the lobby either  so what did my facility fee cover  that was never explained  the only thing we  used  was the bed  bathroom and tv  which comes with any hotel room  and should be included in the price of the hotel  those shouldn t be considered as   extras  or  facility fees   moreover  expedia advertises this scummy hotel as having free wifi  hmmm  so if that s part of the facility fee  then it s not free  i ve been to ny lots of times  no hotel has ever charged this ridiculous fee  it s like  you charged me twice for the same room  the only reason i picked this hotel  was because with the pride festivities going on  everything was booked  or the prices were higher than usual  this hotel was advertised as      night on expedia  my brother paid for me and his daughter  my niece  to stay there for   nights  the price was      total  that should ve covered everything that comes with the hotel       read more   read less maids either came at   am or    pm  very sporadic and inconvenient times  was  not notified of a     per night parking fee  when i attempted to park  the lot

beds room was not available since the property manager had  guests  in the hotel not registered that had taken my room  and another   i was given my key and when i eneterd my room it was occupied and this is how the unregistered guest were discovered      i was changed into   room  disappointing as i was with my kids   the new room had dirty bedsheets  no toilet paper and door lock not functioning  not nice given that somebody maybe issued a key for an occupied roon as it happend to me   the next day when i returned to the room the room was not done     i called and the reception required me to go down and get keys for another room   i was extremely disappointed to be forced to change again the room     but there was no way to stay in my room sunce they would not make it therefore me and my kids had to move to another room  this time   beds     the new room had the phone not working  in summary a poorly managed property  a lot of staff is chinese as well and speek little or broken

good night  we would never have found the room and we would have had to hump all those bags upstairs by ourselves if the van driver had not come and helped us  big thumbs down to the desk clerk   he might have offered us a ground floor room  secondly  there was no way to turn on a light in the room when we got there  no wall switches or card swipes   had to walk into a dark room and feel around for a light switch for the desk lamp  the shower head delivered a very weak stream of water and the shower curtain was broken on the shower head side of the tub  so water all over the floor  the only

that we didn t care for on this visit was the lack of umbrellas at the pools  there were maybe   umbrellas total surrounding two pools  the first time we were here  there was an umbrella for ever four lounge chairs  this being summer and over    degrees on any given day  a little shade is necessary  it was so hot we couldn t stay at the pool for more than an hour as we had nowhere to retreat from the sun  also  the pool towels were lacking as well  in two days we had to ask for the towels to be replenished and on sunday the pool attendant said we would have to wait an hour for towels and that we should go back to our room and take our room towels to use that day  the lack of people at the pool would probably be an indication that the abscense of shade and towels was an issue for others as well  we come to florida to spend time at the pool and to not be able to do what we love to do on vacation will certainly come into play when we schedule our next visit  unless the umbrella situation

absolutely ridiculous  my husband then had to park over two blocks away on the street  if we wanted street parking there were many other hotels that were less expensive where we could have stayed

like she just didn t want to deal with me or the   other people kept waiting because there was an elderly couple that checked in right before me   they got a room  everyone else was forced to wait for  pm  she didn t call a manager  she was on her phone texting  and while she was checking in the elderly couple she answered her personal phone to chat  talk about unprofessional  same thing happened at check out  i only needed the room for a few hours to get some sleep so i didn t even stay the whole night  i m waiting at the counter for at least      minutes before someone assisted me now mind you there are   girls at the counter this time around and no line  i was the only one in the lobby  one was actually on the phone with a customer so she obviously couldn t help me  fine  the other one was texting on her phone   completely ignoring me  i was really unsatisfied with the staff  the one one that actually made me feel like a valued customer was the man that checked me in  smiled when

discrepancy i rushed to the front desk  at first the man was very haughty and told me they did not have the room type we ordered and paid for  even without an apology for this situation  so i request for a partial refund  he refused and said that we had booked room via expedia  we should ask for refund or compensation from expedia not the hotel directly  i was cross and continued to explain to this guy that the bunker bed was what we had promised to our daughter and now my daughter was so frustrated up there  maybe due to my persistence  he at last told me that there was only and the last such room as i had booked  since the guest hadn t showed up yet  he agreed to change us to that room  and at      we finally moved to the room with a bunker  but the experience we had undergone was so unhappy  i should say this is a really costly hotel but with unsatisfying customer services in synch with its charges  i think i deserve an apology  so i won t recommend it       read more   read less

outdated but clean    double beds in our room  room service menu  didn t use though  and decent sized room overall   tad larger than d value resort rooms   overall  i would absolutely stay again

jose airport  the hotel offers a shuttle to and from the    miles away  airport   jordan helped us on our arrival and was fairly indifferent  bordering on rude  upon our return to the san jose airport  we followed their instructions to call for a shuddle when we were ready   that was at     pm  after about    minutes of waiting  we called the front desk who told us they d call the driver to find out where he was  after another    minutes we called again and they said he was on his way  long story short  he arrived at the airport at     pm  in the hour we sat there waiting we saw all the other airport shuttles come by     times so i d definitely recommend any other hotel   when we talked to the driver he told us he was on his lunch break  we talked to jordan at the front desk about our frustration and he was short  rude  and seemed like he could really care less  when we asked why it took so long he said he didn t know the driver was on his lunch break  i asked why he didn t know and he said because he was also on break  i guess my frustration lies in the fact that every other business functions while employees are on breaks  but apparently this hotel shuts down while the employees take their breaks  the room was overpriced and for the price to leave your car overnight  you would hope they could get you a shuddle after a long day of travel in less than an hour

that same day  we think that knocked was un necessary and very inconsiderate from their part to wake up someone that early just for a reminder like if we didnt know or like if we were passed our check

which  in addition to being much smaller  also had a broken closet door  leaking shower fixtures and a lingering smell of cigarette smoke  despite the property being advertised as smoke free  thankfully  when we spoke to amalia at the front desk the next morning  she was very helpful and had us moved to the king room we had reserved  i very much appreciate her help and dedication to customer service     i cannot say the same for orbitz  after speaking to two customer service reps  who offered me coupons for future stays but were not authorized to issue a refund  i spoke with a manager who explained there was nothing he could do  because orbitz s terms of service permit them to give you a different  less expensive room than what you paid for  and there is nothing you can do about it  that right  i paid for a king room  they gave me a much smaller queen room  and then refused to refund the difference  the csrs i spoke with at least tried to help  the manager clearly did not care whether i got what i paid the company for or not  i ve been using orbitz for over    years and have had mostly positive experiences  but they completely dropped the ball this time  and i m not sure whether i will use them again  the measly amount of rewards i get compared to booking directly is not worth the hassle when something goes wrong       read more   read less this appears to be

carpets had been cleaned many times to try to get the smell out  beds were clean  bathroom was not  the toilet was dirty when we arrived      the pool area was fun  but difficult to access  it took us a while to figure out how to get out there because of lack of signs and it seamed like you had to go out a service area to get to the pool area  no grand entrance and just a little confusing  but once on the pool deck there were things for the kids to do and a nice big pool and hot tub      the lobby area is nice and updated  there was a bar  breakfast and ice cram area  staff was friendly and check in was fast and efficient  however the woman working at the desk that checked us in could not clearly explain in english how to get to our room and drew circles all over the hotel map  which

the tub also drained slowly  they said they have never had a customer that has had so many issues and gave me the standard lip service  yea   right     it is clearly a management issue   they just don

work stay  the first night was just ok but i woke up with a horrible back issue  when i arose from the bed you could hear the springs pop  left for work and put the service room card on the door  when we returned we noticed that a spot that was on the sheets was there again  i also sleep with earplugs in my ears and when we noticed the spot i pulled back the sheets and found my earplugs in the bed which told me that the sheets were not changed  when i called down to the front desk  jordan answered the phone  i asked if servicing the room and not changing the sheets was customary he asked if i wanted housekeeping to come up to change the sheets and i replied that i wanted to know why it wasnt done in the first place to which he replied  i have no idea i dont work in housekeeping  he was rude and snarky and in no way tried to calm the situation  housekeeping came up and called the keeper from the a m to tell her what happened at which time i told her i had pictures which killed the convo  left us uneasy about how long sheets were on that bed and whether the towels were clean or just refolded from our previous days use  the next morning my back was worse but checked out with a

unlocked  just a push of the door and anyone could easily enter the room  we let the front desk know again and the issue was never resolved  thankfully no one took anything from our room  but this is

is in a great location  literally across one bridge from disney springs and the foyer and main section of the hotel are beautifully decorated with great facilities  it s very welcoming  i was on a

little dark of my own choice as i didn t want to open curtains onto the car park  and the shower was great      everyone i encountered working was friendly and happy to help  and the bus services to the parks were great and easily on par with the disney service  which was one of my worries  as long as you don t mind visiting multiple parks on your way to the one you re going to  tip  if you want to go to epcot  but missed that bus  get the magic kingdom one as it drops you at the monorail station for epcot too  then get a bus to disney springs back later as you can walk from the stop to the hotel easily      for the price and location i was happy to overlook the room location  and if you re going to spend most of your time at the parks you ll only really be there at night  so it s not as

day it was very noticeable that the floor had not been swept  they are not carpet so everything shows  and the bathroom sink had not been cleaned thoroughly  i noticed but it was not a giant deal to me and i was tired so i did not go down and report it  i probably should have     my trip was not for pleasure so the location was fine but  if you are coming to see nyc  i can see that the location

however  if i hadn t been so tired i would have switched hotels  due to the lack of sleep we all got staying here  i was kind of surprised they would allow such a loud party with music to go on so late in their main facility being that rooms are so close to it  it was extremely frustrating to my teenage boys as well who needed to sleep because their volleyball tournament started again early on sunday  we will not be staying here again  but i really hope they fix fire out a better way to block out noise and light if they are going to allow big parties in their facility in the evenings  very

another issue with being locked out and then our rooms were not clean  we made the best of since we were tired but we were not happy with the outcome of each day at the hotel  i wish these issue had a

many hotels that would accommodate   adults and a baby as we wanted   beds and a crib  booked a deluxe double       at the new yorker and couldn t have been happier    i only live an hour from the city but i have never stayed overnight until recently at this hotel  all i have to say is that i couldn t have asked for a better first experience  i was staying over in the city for a very special occasion and this hotel made it even better  i got  me and my friend stayed stayed here on our first trip to new york  it seems to be the most popular in the travel agents   new york forums amongst many different travellers  we got the train and off at pennyslvania station it s right across the road so easy access and a short  i was not a guest of the new yorker wyndam hotel  however  i was so disappointed by the hotel staff that i will never stay there  my husband was staying there on business  which happened to overlap with his birthday  in the    years  we have been together  we have never been  we had two rooms on the   th floor of the new yorker  the plus point were the views directly of the empire state building and the friendly staff in the hotel  especially the cheery guy who serves the coffees and teas in the foyer  the shower was a bit weird it was either very  stayed in the new yorker hotel for   nights on our first night stayed in a room on floor    the room was very

reasonable  rooms in hotel are small but adequate for    security is good in the hotel  the staff on reception are unfriendly we  great location  we traveled into nyc by train and it is only a half block from penn station  they upgraded us to a corner suite with an incredible view so we were blown away by their service  we will be back  this hotel has been around a long time and despite renovations is weary  the decor in the room was dull and beige  my room did not have a good view and was dreary and dismal  not much light was let in from the window  while the bedding was new and updated  the furniture  stayed for two nights on a brief trip to ny  the location is great  right by penn station and loads of shops nearby  we arrived much earlier than expected and were pre checked in and were able to leave our bags whilst we went sight seeing  the room was good  although pretty  spent   nights at the new yorker and we opted for a double metro room with a view  great view of the empire state building  only downside to this was it was a little noisy with the traffic and the sirens  but i expected it in new york  rooms were clean and the double metro  just reopened does pub food  not a massive menu but what it does do it does very well love the place  good beer and wine also you can take dogs into the bar where there are doggie treats for them  service is excellent and everyone is very friendly  this is the third year we have stayed at the new yorker and i wouldn t stay anywhere else when visiting nyc  the views are breathtaking  the rooms are clean and spacious  the staff is friendly and professional  i always recommend this hotel for travelers  what a great palace woww    is was a veerry vwerry nice oplace to vit with the friends and family   soooo great

very accessible to all new york attractions   wyndham membership makes it easy to book   use points to book stay very quickly  historical hotel near metro   bus terminals for other cities  great location and friendly hotel  the building retains the character of when it was built and some of the rooms are a little small  but comfortable and provide a safe base for what just needs to be a place to eat  drink and rest  across the road is the madison square garden   lynda was amazing at check in  we loved the tick tock dinner  the trattoria next door and the restaurant below  everything was amazing including the location  i love the   s and this was all of the charm but service of a chain hotel that you trust  the maid service was so  a disappointing stay  the rooms are small  very dated  dark  no amenities  the hotel is busy and crowded with waits for reception and even bag check  the location is not great   busy and noisy part of town  limited good restaurants near by  far from good places to visit like  we paid extra for city view and got a corner room with a view  but the size of a walk in closet  comfortable bed  clean linens  but old faucets made it hard to regulate heat in shower  either scalding or cold  adequate closet space  but one torn chair  so heavy and cumbersome it  this is my go to hotel in the city  you can t get better value for money in midtown manhattan than at the new yorker  in my opinion  and i ve always felt welcomed and right at home  staff are all professional and kind  the establishment has an environmentally friendly approach   great hotel  requested a high floor with view  was not disappointed  could not do early check in because they had been sold out the night before  based on traveling during christmas season we were not very surprised that they couldn t take us early  left our bags with bell  friendly convenient and very clean and comfortable  great location  easy access to train station and theater district  a lot of great attractions and restaurants nearby  nice in hotel restaurant and bar  it is the second time we stay at the wyndham newyorker at we had the best holiday ever  everything worked  from the tours  the food and the hotel  this time we got a room away from the street and we slept like babies  a perfect week  firstly the positives   the wyndham new yorker has a lot of history  there s a small free museum downstairs   and you can t really beat the location  literally a stone s throw from madison square garden and       mins from empire state building and times square  there are   or    friendly staff and lovely hotel in the heart of of the city  close to all shops and the empire state building also time square was a    min walk away  would say the only down side was there was no drinks facilities in the room but seeing as there are shops everywhere around this  beautifully decorated for the holidays  this historic art deco hotel with modern conveniences less than two blocks from penn station and macy s has larger than normal nyc rooms with very comfortable beds  exceptional staff service  a    hour retro diner and excellent italian  stayed for   nights last week  first off the good points  hotel central and within walking distance of penn station  macy s  empire state building  times square and a decent walk to central park  bad points  on checking in we where given the key cards to a room on the   th floor  the new yorker is in a prime location  we went to nyc to see billy joel at madison square garden  the hotel is across the street  it is also steps from penn station  the hotel is a historical building and they do a great job highlighting it s history to include an exhibit on the  the new yorker is well located and that s why i loved to stay here  and i love korean food around this hotel there is tons o koreans restaurants so perfect  the rooms are big enough  and clean  the only downside was when i came off the lifts the floor carpets needed an upgrade   this is an amazing historic property  we ended up in the tesla room  where nikola tesla lived and died  i was so honored to be randomly assigned this room  everything was wonderful expect the water temperature  the shower went from pleasant to scalding and then to freezing  we  room was small but very efficient for the two of us  only problem we had  which is usually not a complaint  is getting cold water    location was great   close proximity to times square  subway  and much more  the tick tock diner connected to the hotel is reasonably priced and  my family and i had an amazing stay from           our room was extremely spacious with   beds    closets and a separate sitting area with   chairs and a small table  the property was very well maintained and the staff were all wonderful  the location was perfect for sight  second time staying here  and i d have to say i d be hard pressed to find a better place to stay when visiting nyc  if you re in town to see a show at the garden  relax  it ll take you all of    seconds to walk to the front doors  since most shows don t start exactly at the  excellent location  friendly staff  fast check in check out  spacious double room in  th floor  stylish lobby  walking distance to times square  many restaurant and coffeeshop around    h grocery store in front of the hotel  parking is   usd and   usd for suv  for hotel guests   large  busy centrally located hotel  awesome facilities  gym  and tick tick diner nice for breakfast  rooms and bathroom are neat and tidy although quite small  lovely view of the eps and surrounding buildings  only reason why i didn t give   stars is the hotel was extremely  easy  friendly check in  suite room was a great size for new york  the view from the   th floor is amazing  we has a clear shot of the empire state and msg  closets were spacious  and the mini keurig was amazing  also loved the stocked mini fridge  water  coke  and diet coke  it  ideal hotel to stay     mins from time square   on the junction of    st    th ave  rooms clean   tidy   but a bit of modernisation wouldn t go amiss  plenty of restaurants   bars close by  italian restaurant connected to hotel is top quality   reasonably priced  would stay  had an excellent stay at the new yorker hotel  rooms very comfortable with good amenities  staff very helpful   polite  excellent diner one side of the hotel  also a very good italian restaurant on the other side  hotel very well located for getting around new york  most  the title of my review really says most of what i wanted to express  the new yorker is an iconic manhattan hotel  i would be disappointed at having to stay anywhere else  except maybe the waldorf astoria   the thing that makes this hotel so appealing is it s history and  i had read reviews of this hotel before i went but i cannot fault my stay  got a queen room with no view  the room was very clean  although not the upgraded ones everything worked and was fine for our stay  we were there for a week and it was a great location  just over the  the newyorker is situated beside madison square gardens a stones throw from times square  we were warned before we went that nyc hotel rooms are small and yes they are but as you are just sleeping there it really wasnt an issue  the check in process was seamless  great security   really nice stay in nyc  hotel was great  location is excellent  penn station across the street we used to go to newark for a hockey game  plenty to do close by like empire state building  macy s  highline etc  short walk to times square  ate twice at tick tock dinner located  our rooms were great and large for new york  the service was excellent  the subway was right across the street and cabs were always available  i would highly recommend choosing this hotel  i will stay on again on our next trip to new york  i ve never written a review on tripadvisor but i felt compelled to do so after my recent stay at this hotel  i don t care about how modern or hip or whatever bells and whistles most people care about  location and view are more important for me  i usually spend very little time  room size was horrible maybe    x     shower leak all night  made housekeeping aware of the problem was never corrected  vanity space maybe   or   inch very very tiny bathroom  horrible for the price that was paid over         new years weekend  will never stay at this place  we got a great price although our room was tiny  however  new bathroom bathrobe and coffee which not all room have  elevators were always quick and wireless was fine  perfect location and easy block from penn station  no wait for cabs on that long line highly recommend  perfect location within walking distance of penn station  shops and times square  hotel could do with a bit of updating but think it was just the style of hotel  small rooms but perfecting fine as don t spend a lot of time in room  water was lovely but bath was grubby  i m sure the new yorker was a grand old dame in its hey day but it feels very tired today  heating in rooms was very ordinary   it was either full blast hot  which made sleeping tricky  or cold  shower wasn t great and the rooms are very small  the staff were pleasant enough  stayed at the new yorker hotel for   night s with my wife after new year  the hotel is in a fantastic location  right next to penn station and madison square garden  it s also a stone s throw away from the empire state building and times square  as for the hotel it s pretty  we visited new york for the first time over nye       we had an amazing stay and the new yorker provided a clean and calm retreat from the hustle and bustle  our room was large by new york standards and older but always clean  the tic tock diner downstairs was a godsend with  if you want the real new york this is your hotel  right in the middle of the action walking distance to times square the empire state building and most important macys   couldn t of asked for a nicer hotel and more helpful staff  rooms were beautiful and clean beds were huge to  spent our honeymoon at the new yorker  check in was pretty easy and all very friendly i did e mail in advance to see if they could do anything as it s our honeymoon unfortunately they couldn t but we were promised a bottle of wine when we checked in and was told this would be in  we stayed here in january and the hotel is in a fabulous location  the rooms are small which is what you expect in a large city however the hotels is looking a little tired  the rooms need to be redecorated along with the corridors  the plumbing is noisy and you can here  what a delight this hotel is  steeped in history  all of which is proudly preserved  whether within the elegance of the hotel or in its small museum downstairs  it holds many stories within its walls  the staff are delightful at all times  check in was fast and proficient yes  hotel was quick to get to from newark airport  we upgraded to a suite which was no trouble for the staff  all staff were friendly and went out their way to help  great location opposite madison square garden and close to penn station  our suite was on level    and from the  great location and lobby staff  kindly upgraded us due to a birthday  but problems with the most important thing  wasn t clean  visible dust dirt layers on tops of tile  baseboards  bathroom light  debris on floor found when opened curtains  housekeeping didn t come to clean  the hotel staff were awesome from the front desk  housekeeping and security staff  room was big for nyc although a little older but very clean and well appointed  wonderful lobby area with old nyc charm  met some nice guests waiting on taxi or uber    doorman was great  food at  i was very pleased with resort  it s a beautiful property  close proximity to disney parks   disney springs is a plus  the rooms were very nice  the double queen with bunk beds is perfect if traveling with a child ren   my daughter loved having her own space   tv    the hidden fees added up to     per a night  just the fee for   nights costed me      the shuttle service information given by the hotel front deck was wrong  the pick up stops were wrong  i have reported it to hotel front desk but they seems to not care  i lucky to met with  i was there for the fsoma conference and had a great time  i hope we have our conference there again next year  the staff was very friendly and helpful   and rick at the bell station was extremely helpful in giv ng me directions  thank you for a great stay  wyndham grand orlando resort bonnet creek is a luxury resort with family friendly theme  if you purchase a room with balcony  you can view the walt disney fireworks  the pools have a  theme  with a  legend  of a lost pirate base that is now the ponds  breakfast was at      at the wyndham grand bonnet creek  it was everything we hope for on our disney vacation  the family room with the bunk beds made sleeping arrangements easily  the vanity outside the bathroom was key to keeping us on schedule  it was a great disney vacation  i met my friend here for a girls weekend  it was great  nice spa  beautiful grounds and good food  rick  the bellman was so very helpful in arranging things for us  i will probably return with my family   there s something for everyone there  best hotel i ve ever stayed in by far stayed on the   th floor seen fireworks every night gorgeous room back bat food at poolside is lovely  and i must say staff are so polite and attentive but rick is by far the best there he was so helpful and polite and gave me great  i was staying here while attending a conference that was also scheduled at this hotel  what a treat  great food  beds and wonderful service from all the staff  enjoyed every minute  i tried several new foods and drinks and loved everything  went on this trip with my wife  was so easy to get around with shuttles and lots to do with kids from water slides and pools  favourite part was definitely feeding the ducks  coy fish  catfish turtles and birds  everyone from check in to check out were extremely accommodating  the room and grounds were very clean and well kept  especially  the bell hop rick was so friendly and informative on what to do around the resort  he was the best ending for our stay   thank you rick      this resort is amazing  lots of places to eat  things to do  and multiple pools and hot tubs  we walked the      mile lap around the lake at night  and it was perfectly safe and enjoyable  the room was clean and the fixtures were of high quality  we would definitely stay here  i took a chance on hotwire and i ended up at this resort  i was excited because  my wife and i are trying to stay at every hotel on walt disney world property  drive to hotel   as you make the turn onto chelonia pkwy it builds up some sort of anticipation of seeing what the  take one sip from the fruit infused complimentary water at the entrance and you have already kicked things off on a good note  ultra comfort included with beds inclusive of multiple sheets and pillows fit for a gladiator most decorated  indulge in the breakfast buffet and eat  the stay at the wyndham grand was all in all an exceptional experience  the grounds were immaculate and the pools and hot tubs provided the much needed relaxation i was looking for  the hotel staff were kind and courteous and eager to help  however  as part of a timeshare  the newly updated rooms were so nice and the bed heavenly food was delicious from the special omelette cooked to order  spanish cuisine at lunch and dinner was special with crab cakes and grouper  the chef prepared everything perfectly from presentation to flavors was there for  the staff at the front desk and sales team were all most helpful in ensuring my experience was most pleasant  i was barely there for    hours but felt the warmness of the staff and experienced the beauty of the resort  this resort is beautiful  we ve stayed here previously  their restaurants have delicious food  there service is fantastic  amazing location  just one complain  this time the room we were in wasn t maintained well  the bathroom handle was falling off  we were put in an accessible  i travel to orlando often and have stayed at this property several times in the past  stayed recently and was surprised to see updated rooms  shocked as i believe this hotel is still fairly new  the new rooms look great  looks like new furniture  carpet and updated color  from check in to check out  the hospitality was exceptional  deep blu was a truly grand experience  chef mclamb  food was outstanding  and our server kathy  awesome   exceeded all expectations  we are so glad to have had the opportunity to stay at the wyndham grand  you guys  this resort was fantastic in every waythe rooms were clean and the view was magnificent  the price was right at the right price  not to much or no to little  for a real   start this place was amazing i cant wait to go back  from start  checking in to checking out and everything in between was a great experience  everyone went above and beyond  family wedding  so also used as a venue for ceremony and reception  did a fabulous job   stayed at this resort during labor day weekend of        beautiful resort  huge lobby with coffee shop  great clean sleeping rooms that offered what is needed   big pool for adults and kids with food bar services within steps of your pool chairs   take advantage of surrounding  my family and i had a great stay at wyndham grand resort bonnet creek  i will list my pros and cons here  pros    location is amazing     minutes or less to disney parks and about    minutes to universal    rates vary but i was able to get a great rate thru trip advisors   we were immediately hit up to buy a timeshare upon arrival  the shower took at least    minutes to warm up  bus service to disney was not on the times advertised and ended up taking almost an hour to wait for the bus and drive to one park  had to uber after waiting    minutes  extremely annoyed  the website lists a parlor  junior pres and presidential suite  however  i called to get rates and first person i spoke to stated those did not exist and repeatedly asked if i was on the right website  i had to read her everything i saw and she continued to  wanted to stay close to magic kingdom so i picked this place  i wish i knew it had so much to do on property i wouldn t have bothered to go anywhere else  this place was so amazing  lots of pools  lazy rivers  walking paths around the lake  places to eat  so much to do at this  transportation for disney is severely lacking  couldn t even get to the parks at opening or if you stayed till closing  the rest of the experience was good and their breakfast is amazing  we wouldn t stay here again though  the hotel a little outdated but cleanliness was satisfactory  the breakfast was good and our server  ron  outstanding  however  the day we arrived there was a huge lizard in the hallway of our hotel block  inside   and as we walked the premises there were tons of them  had a great time staying in this hotel  with pools and grills  also was able to watch fireworks from the room i used every night  so i really enjoyed my stay here  wish i can go back and book again in this hotel  hotel is great  staff is not like being at a disney hotel  in a disney resort staff is everywhere to do everything for you  staff is minimal here  it s not a bad thing  your just on your own  also  the buses  are slow  if your traveling with kids it s very hard  be outside  just recently stayed at this hotel for our trip to disney world  first  the service at this resort was impeccable and outstanding  my girlfriend and i checked in very late  shannon rich  the representative at the registration graciously greeted us and checked us in efficiently   hotel had a lot to offer  spacious room with a coffee machine and fridge  there was a safe and plenty room for storage  best of all i could bring my yorkie with me  two large pools  hot tub  restaurant and fire pit  surrounded by a walk way around the lake and some ply ground  this hotel is amazing and very comfortable and accommodating  we wanted a room on the higher floor to view the fireworks and were placed on the fourth floor  when we arrived at our room the view was not that great  the bellman immediately called the front desk to see if a room  we really expected something different but what we got was good  not very good  but wasn t amazing  we stayed in the hotel which is part of a resort with holiday apartments  the resort is spread out over the entire property so if you want to use the arcade  you need to walk  this is one of the best resort i ever stood in  so close to all parks  very clean and just upgraded  we recommended to other travelers  nice big pool area  great restaurant   blue  everyone that works there has been great   we stayed in the new yorker hotel this january   it was a lovely hotel staff were so so lovely rooms can be a bit small but we were moved to a bigger room with no problems at all   staff were on hand all the time and you could ask them anything about the area   would stay here  while i always enjoy the  old new york  feel of this hotel  the hidden facility fees put a damper on my trip  especially since they refused to put it on the company card that booked the trip without    authorizations and a spare kidney  better to just raise the room rate and be  just back in ireland from another great visit to this fabulous hotel   staff are brillant so helpful and informative big shout out to lovely linda at front desk who is so kind and professional  we will be back in april for my moms birthday   cant wait stayed here for   nights at the end of january       and we where very impressed  we had read a few reviews complaining about room size and heating  but being in the heart of manhattan  we found it a comfortable size  and the heating was fine   it is in a  perfect location to  this is not likely to be the smartest hotel you ll ever stay in  but it is very conveniently located  and is good value for money  right near penn station so it is easy and cheap to get there from jfk  great local deli nearby  which is really convenient for a nice breakfast or  we stayed here at the beginning of december  it is a great location  being within walking distance to the majority of attractions in nyc  in my opinion  the decor is very dated  i felt like i was in the      s  what i imagined it to be like   the beds were small also  i d say  i needed to change from a twin to a suite for a trip next week to nyc and was fortunate enough to connect with neida a natural commicator and excellent representative of the hotel  not only was she able to deal with my request efficiently  but more importantly with nice good  absolutely loved this hotel  location is great  so handy for times square  train station etc  also plenty of shops and cafes around it  hotel was also very clean and staff friendly  tick tick restaurant located in hotel was amazing for breakfast and desserts  we also had a view  just returned from   nights here  hotel location is excellent but hotel inside is very dates  rooms are small and dark  plug sockets are not practical at all and limited storage space  very clean though cant be faulted for that  reception was very rude on check in i had   rooms  went to ny with   friends  we shared a room with   beds and it was amazing  the hotel is very clean  beds are comfortable  rooms with an amazing view  the decoration is cool  bathrooms are a little small but its ok  the price we payed was very low compared to other hotels  the staff are lovely and the rooms are huge for new york  it s close to lots of sights  we really enjoyed ourselves and highly recommend this hotel for a family  couples  or business  we will go back  great hotel all the staff very friendly and helpful  rooms clean but dated like most original hotels in new york  the hotel is dog friendly and we had a couple of noisy dogs in the next room  mentioned this to receptionist and she upgraded us to a better room  excellent service  clean  great location  a very professional staff  would highly recommend this hotel when visiting nyc for business or pleasure  if driving park your car across the street at the icon garage  the cab and rapid transit will handle your transport needs  after choosing to visit new york our break took us to the wny hotel it was a pleasure to stay there the hotel was in a perfect location to tour nyc   the hotel has a nice retro feeling and some great features and a small museum where you can find out all about the history of  great hotel in manhattan  close to empire state and subway  i walked from here to central park and ground zero  close to tavern bar  great food and drink  rooms clean  nice staff  buffet breakfast ok too  we have just returned from a   night stay at this hotel  out first impressions were that the hotel appeared to be dated and the room was basic and small  however  we were on floor    and had the most amazing views  the hotel is in the most amazing location as it is within  jose was phenomenal  he handled me with compassion and professionalism  he calmed me down and diffused a potential blow up  my reservations were incorrect  wyndham assured me it would be corrected by the time i arrived on saturday  it was not  jose patiently worked with me  i return to this hotel every year for the westminster kennel club dog show  the staff go out of their way to make you feel like an honored guest  two in particular  mohammed and neida are so wonderful with their help to make sure my stay is always superb  i had to ask for a  the hotel is famous for many things  one being where nikola tesla lived and sadly died back in       there are still questions being asked about what happened once he died and all of his research stored at the hotel  but back to the drink  to the left of the lobby  downstairs  stayed here at the beginning of this year  was a lovely stay and the staff were so kind  the room was a nice size however the shower didn t work very well and water came out of both the bath tap and the shower head at the same time causing very little power in the shower water   clean  comfy and a great area  the hotel is clean  especially the rooms  the beds are very comfortable  the rooms are of a good size  it is in a great area of manhattan  very central to start your days out in nyc we stayed in the new yorker hotel from  th     th december  our first impression of the hotel was that it was very grand and not what we are used to back home  travel lodges and premier inns  being an absolute christmas nut i was amazed by the beautiful tree in the lobby  the  everyone from the doorman  bellman  front desk  reservations  catering and sales give fabulous service  i have stayed st this hotel for    years and never been disappointed  it always feels like i m  coming home  when i arrive  i always choose the new yorker for my   monthly family trips to new york  for me there is no choice   great location  great staff  fabulous building and comfortable room  i always have a twin double bed metro room   the hotel has a lot of character and history  the staff cannot  myself and daughter have just returned from our trip and stayed at the new yorker for   nights  hotel is lovely and historic  staff were fantastic  room was an adequate size for us  very clean and warm and lovely bath tub with plenty hot water  we could pick no faults at all   after reading other reviews i fear people are missing the point of this hotel  the decor in all areas from the lobby to the corridors is definitely of art deco influences  what others are seeing as  outdated  is merely the hotels choice of decor in line with the style and age of  first of all the tap water is so dirty so showering was out of the question  see photo   paid for a suite   three people got one bed    what are they thinking in the reception  never paid so much for such poor quality  when we arrived late at night they knew it would be three of us  we booked a suite  wow  and payed almost      for one night  when we came to the room we had one bed and one pullout bed that wasn t even made so we had to call room service and they came    mins later  got the  i have stayed here before and had a wonderful time  this time was horrible  the first night our hotel key didn t work  instead of changing the cards like the security guy said they made us change rooms  they told us we would be upgraded  our room was the exact same with a worse  very nice and clean hotel with large rooms  very focused on guest safety as you need a room key to show to get from lobby to elevators for guests  very attentive to guest satisfaction and even had someone knock on the door to ask how the service was  two restaurants are off the  our ny suite was adequate in housing   of us who were there for the westminster dog show including our show dog  special thanks to kelvin diaz for accommodating our entire group of handlers and dogs on the same floor  kudos to the entire staff for being extremely helpful and  just returned from   nights at new yorker  great location for sure  door and security staff are great  the women on reception are less so  very abrupt and prickly  the room was a good size spotlessly clean and beds very comfortable  only real downside is no tea   coffee  i stayed with my daughter in dec      for a second time and during the course of the stay there was  unfortunately  cause for complaint  when i arrived home  via email i was dealt with extremely professionally by megan who i believe is a customer service manager  she resolved my  very grand hotel with a great gatsby feel to it  our room was a little on the small side   but it was perfectly clean and bed was comfortable which is needed after long days sightseeing  we had some trouble with the shower not running very hot on out first day  but it seemed to  we would like to commend all the staff at the wyndham new yorker  who carried out their duties excellently  extremely helpful and accommodating  our room     was a perfect environment to unwind  sleep following our days of sightseeing around the city  we arrived at the new yorker hotel very tired with   children in our party  when we checked in we got told they needed a credit card to take      plus tax off this was for the  nights we was staying  when we questioned this we got told we had to pay room tax per night  none of  the new yorker hotel  location  location  location  see the sights  madison square garden  fifth avenue  empire state building  herald square  close at hand  enjoy true new york experience  ride the subways  walk the neighborhoods  meet the new yorker people from the streets to  stayed at this location for a january event and was pleasantly surprised when we received an upgrade through wyndham rewards  in addition the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful  the room we were put in had the extra room which made the stay even better  as rooms in nyc  i have been attending the wkc shows since      and have stayed at the new yorker since       fabulous location  clean rooms and comfy beds  one short block to penn stn and msg    short blocks to times square and one long block to macy s  talk about location location location    just returned after a   night stay  we could not fault this hotel  yes it is an older hotel as people have stated but it adds to the charms  surprised to read some of the comments  the staff were fantastic  friendly and helpful with any questions we had  the hotel felt so safe   we have just returned to the uk having spent   nights in new york at the new yorker hotel  prior to the trip we were apprehensive having read some negative reviews but we needn t have worried  on arrival the check in staff were efficient  getting us up the line quickly  we were  we often stay at the new yorker hotel and we always enjoy this beautiful hotel and its location close to everything in manhattan  the staff is always professional  helpful and courteous and the hotel itself has many amenities so that you don t even have to leave it  it has  this is our second stay at this hotel  and it will become our future hotel on our visits to new york  staff are professional and helpful  the room was clean and comfortable  though small  we weren t in it except to sleep  just returned from a   night stay  as everyone mentions  location is fantastic  close to time square  and penn subway station on   th  also less than   min walk to port authority bus station on  th ave  room  on floor     was dated  as was every area we were in  corridors etc   we stayed here for   nights  the hotel is in a lovely building in a great location   right near madison square gardens and penn station  we stayed at this hotel as we found a great deal on love holidays that we couldn t turn down and it did the job for what we needed it for   from the time you pull up to the new yorker    it is service with a smile  everyone is friendly and very helpful  the rooms are pleasant and housekeeping is always close by for assistance  to me  the showers are the best part of the room  strong  forceful  hot and relaxing  arrived here on       was a bit dubious as read some reviews  but we needn t have worried  amazing hotel   yeah maybe a little dated but this adds to its charm  friendly staff  couldn t do enough for us  tick tock is amazing they do the best breakfasts an dinners  not too  excellent location beautiful room wonderful helpful staff i can definitely recommend this hotel my room was spacious and comfortable the bed was extremely comfortable i was able to walk from penn station right to the hotel without any trouble dining options in the hotel are  we arrived in nyc via amtrak  penn station  the hotel was a short walk from the station  since the room was not ready when we arrived we were able to check our bags for a small fee  we were right down the street from the empire state building and within a    minute walk to  stayed at the new yorker in february for a   night break to new york  room was quite small but was offered an upgrade on arrival  but felt as we would only spend time in the room to sleep it was not worth the extra money  we were very surprised how close the hotel was to  it s a okay hotel for the price  lots of hidden fees  room are cheap but you have resort fee        then a deposit of      rooms are mediocre  our room door look like someone tried to break in the air in room was terrible didn t get cool until morning  iron was broke and tub and  pros  great location  close to a bunch of nice restaurants and entertainment cold silent air conditioner very comfy bed  coming from goldie locks  this is a big deal  very good food at the conference nice banquet rooms plenty of hot water shower caps and hair ties are included  i attended a four day convention at this property  there is a central newer building complex with hotel services  two restaurants anchoring each end of a long connected series of seach with bars and a whole wing of conference meeting facilities  the motel rooms are in separated  my second year here and things are over all much improved  i hosted a prearranged lunch for    of my colleagues and i want to express appreciation to the on property restaurant gatorville manager on duty  marilyn rodriguez  our food was ready and the section was set up for us  we booked in here for   nights whilst in florida  we were in block   to begin with and the room was filthy with stains on the seating and walls  we asked to be moved to block   and were moved to another room which we initially thought was better  but on closer inspection we  fantastic location  rooms a little aged but very clean and comfortable  all the staff we encountered where very helpful and courteous   this is our second stay at this resort hotel  i would highly recommend it  many thanks wyndham for making our stay a pleasure  rooms dirty and unserviceable noisy air on  you can hear everything he next door neighbours are saying through the bathroom vent  one of the large pools is mouldy and poorly maintained  staff at breakfast are outstanding and the only asset to this hotel  we had a great weekend trip  good food  room was clean  pool and bar area was awesome  would have liked for the room to have bigger bed options but i guess we booked later than usual so they were not available the standard   double bed is small for   people  my niece slept on the floor  but the bed itself is very comfortable as long as only one person sleeps on it  the resort fee is high  and the     per night for room service should be an option  at least if you don t order meals the  stayed at hotel for business conference      plus attendees  room on first look was hot  called guest services and was told how to operate the thermostat  the room would never cool below    degrees  even while set at    degrees or less  front desk was informed  the room   spent five nights here and could not fault it  rooms are small but very clean and the shower and bath a godsend in the cold weather  staff are helpful and it s a relaxed atmosphere in lobby  great location opposite madison sq garden  definitely recommend  lovely hotel we was upgraded to a room with a great view corner room   window looks out to madison square garden the other window up to the empire state building room was clean small but was only a base most of the staff are very rude and abrupt especially the security who  small rooms  great location  no hot water to shower in the morning  clean property  friendly staff  price was a bit higher than other hotels but the location is great  went to a hockey game at msg very convenient  close and great food nearby  booked via travel rupublic for   nights  it does state on web site that there is a resort fee to be paid at the hotel but after researching this and reading previous reviews this seemed to be optional based on services used  this fee is not optional  the services you are paying  this hotel was perfect for our stay  with the room overlooking the hudson river and a nicely sized room  the location of the hotel was also great with it only being a few blocks from times square and alain on the same street as the empire state building  the rest of manhattan  i stayed here september   th just for one night  the room was good it could have been updated a bit  the hardwood floors were alright  it kept the floors very cool throughout the day  the hotel is very spacious  they were alot of buildings to stay in throughout the resort    stayed for    nights aug sep with my family  after reading some of the bad reviews on here i was scared about what i would find but was pleasantly surprised  yes the rooms are dated but clean  the location was fantastic  able to walk to a variety of restaurants and shops  drive  room price was decent but the quality of the room sucked   hotel is in desperate need of an update   walls were so paper thin that i could hear the people nextdoor s conversations and the people above me having sex   room service left the dirty dishes outside one of the doors  here for a work conference  this is a great location  plenty of restaurants and activities within walking distance  hotel is spread out in multiple buildings  conference area is nice  i wouldn t mind returning during my annual family vacation  short distance to theme parks and  well from the start our door did not lock properly and got locked in room  there where pubic hairs and hairs around the bath and toilet when we first arrived  on the second day our door was left open by the maid  all day  through faulty door   we had to get the room fumigated  the new yorker is probably the best hotel i ve ever stayed in  every interaction with staff was great  particularly the wonderful lady who checked us in and made every endeavour to make our special trip even more special  even the people that checked our room keys for security  arrived from england having already been informed by my brother in law who had stayed at the wyndham that i might find the room not that big  but that it had not dampened his time at the hotel  he had pointed out that it was more than adequate for his stay  when booking in we  on arrival we were greeted by two lovely ladies who offered us an upgrade to larger rooms with two double beds  tv  tea   coffee making machine  two wardrobes  good bathroom  great shower   bathrobes   hairdryer  there were   ladies in our party so good facilities for two  fabulous hotel in the heart of manhattan   great for getting around new york with everything so close   the hotel is great lovely clean rooms    staff sometimes seem a little abrupt but i think that s a new york thing    overall recommend to all we came to new york   th february for   nights staying at the new yorker hotel on  th avenue  the hotel is really good  definitely check about paying resort tax  this is for amenities you may not use  wifi in the rooms  gym etc  our room was small but comfy  slept like a log in  very central and across from madison square gardens  tic tic dinner which has a entrance from lobby was great for breakfast  and staff very warm and friendly  room we were in was small but was ok   very retro but all mod cons were there  the hotel is in a great location  to the right is penn station  over the road are subway lines and about a    minute walk to the left up  th and across   nd is times square  it had the advantage of   on site restaurants in the building offering diner style to fine dining  just  stayed here for   nights and although the room was small  it was ok for the time we spent in there  a coffee maker would have been beneficial  its location was great for exploring new york  walking distance to lots of great places  arrived on   th feb    rooms for   people  to be told that they did not have a room for me and my daughter  after a long flight  i was so worried  they said travel bag had cancelled   of the rooms  they decided to put me and my daughter in a suite  with a fabulous view of the  stayed here for   nights last month  great hotel with very helpful staff  bedroom was on the small side but very comfortable and clean  only in it to sleep anyway  great location with subways and trains close by to go anywhere  the diner ticktock was excellent too  can t wait to  our room didn t have even basic cable and the room never got cold at night  we tried to see if it was the box that was not plugged but then we just realized that no it just didn t even have cable on the tv  visited for   weeks from  rd september to   th  have been to florida a fair amount of times and always stay here  emailed prior to arriving to be asked to be put into a room with an interior corrider as i feel these are better rooms and this was no problem  location is second to  only travelled a short distance for a one night get away but it was very nice  loved the environment once we found it  a bit confusing getting into the property  we ate outside to save a little on food  resort food and beverage prices are just that   resort prices   staff was  wanted a room w a balcony and called wyndham     reservation number  this was a same day reservation so i was desperate  boy do i regret it  the hallways were poorly lit and had a stale smell  i usually look at tripadvisor reviews but because of the lack of time i didn t  if i  was concerned after reading reviews but was presently surprised   stayed for a week on  th september   great hotel in excellent shape location near to shops and local amenities  hotel reception were very helpful and buffet breakfast at gatorville restaurant was good although  our first time to new york staying in the new yorker and certainly won t be our last  perfect central location  right next to penn station  port authority and short walk from times square  an old  established  iconic new york hotel  room very comfortable and clean  friendly and  the staff was very friendly  the location was perfect  just across from penn station msg  the rooms were dated and tiny  but clean  the walls were thin and you could hear the people around you  it was perfectly fine for my fianc  and i who were just staying for a night after the  staff was very nice   helpful  especially the man at the desk when we checked in very late  offered us late check out which was most appreciated  hotel room was clean  comfortable   very convenient to penn station   empire state building  bathroom a little dated   cracked tiles  there is a charge for early check in  when checked out charge for holding your suitcases prior to leaving the hotel  no tea and coffee facilities  cheaper to buy a kettle and some cups    which we did     booked a standard room with queen bed  assuming my friend and i had a bed  we stayed for   nights during half term  upon arrival check in was very smooth and we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite with amazing views of the empire state building  i found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful and in particular i am very gtrateful to a  wow  just returned from a wonderful stay at the new yorker  wyndham with my sister and my daughters  as a travel writer  i have travelled extensively  and i must say this hotel was top notch  the service was wonderful  the view stunning  the location perfect  special mention  we had an executive view double room  we were told when we booked that these rooms had undergone a complete renovation  that was very questionable  the shower leaked all over the floor  we put towels down to soak up the water  the sink was so small you couldn t turn the  great hotel   literally opposite penn station  can see it across the street if you come out at  th avenue  check in swift and and friendly  lobby really nice  art deco with a really cool vibe  our room was on the   th floor  brilliant view of madison square garden  and the  this was my first time visiting new york along with   other friend and this hotel and hospitality was incredibly disappointing  months before arriving  we had requested two twin beds  but when we arrived in reception  we were informed that if we wanted twin beds it would cost  the new yorker is in a great location right next to penn station  making going to and from jfk airport very easy via subway or lirr  it is also well placed for the tourist sights and of course all the great shopping  we ha a lovely double room on the   th floor with twin double  i have stayed in this hotel on several occasions over the past few years while attending afo  i don t think i have ever had a truly bad experience here  rooms have nice decor and are very modern looking  the hotel has two pools which is nice  we requested a bottom floor room  i stayed for   days for a microsoft conference  overall  my experience was very poor  the hot water was broken for an entire day so i couldn t have a hot shower in my room that day  the wifi in my room stopped working for the last three days  and it wasn t fixed after i reported  stayed   nights for my daughters wedding  once again didn t disappoint  this is our second visit  the room we we originally allocated had a saggy bed and very noisy air con  after one night we asked for a new mattress and for the air on to be looked at  we were moved to another  hotel grounds were nice  rooms small  but clean and well serviced  staff very friendly and helpful  worked well for my stay while attending a conference at the occc  on my last day i spent two hours in their gatorville restaurant after checking out  waiting until i needed to  stayed a few years ago and has definitely declined since our last stay very expensive and the breakfast at the pool bar was awful cold and not very appetising and staff were very grumpy think they prefer conference people to holiday makers good hotel  central location  rooms reasonably clean  comfortable beds  would stay again close  walking distance to everywhere  quite rooms  enjoyed my stay            nice view from the window   you can see anew york city as others have mentioned  this hotel is in an ideal mid town location  but we found our room to be disappointingly small and in need of updating    tired  being an apt description  we arrived late evening after a flight delay and the receptionist made a show of searching on his  we booked the new yorker based on the location that it had  right on the  th avenue  next to madison square garden  perfect location and great area to be in  the front desk team was great and very helpful  same as the concierge  that helped us with maps and booking an airport  recently stayed here on a five night trip with my husband as a birthday treat  thanks to jose for upgrading us to a suite with amazing views  great location for exploring nyc and that s exactly what we done  i would recommend this hotel as nothing was too much bother  came to this hotel for my stay in nyc this week  as we were going to see elton john at madison square garden on march  th  couldn t ask for this hotel to be more perfectly located  as we came in on the train from new jersey  and penn station is a very short walk away  was also  from the moment we arrived check in smooth and efficient  the hotel is old charm from top to bottom  staff very helpful and rooms very comfortable  walking around new york is easy from the perfect location and will stay here again if i return  first class    this is my favorite ny hotel  location  atmosphere  friendly staff  everything  sure  it s not a luxury hotel but that s really not the point  but this time i was disappointed  i took my    year old son  first time in ny  and requested and paid for a room with a view of the  this was our first time in new york and straight away found the staff very helpful  the hotel itself is ideally situated for madison square gardens and the empire state building  there s lots of staff around the lobby more than willing to help you  the rooms are clean and  it was art deco but not modern  nothing was kept up with the diner  and italian restaurant are good just not good customer service  i asked for a cot with pillows and a blanket and was denied   so offensive i have stayed in the new yorker each time i ve come to the city for business and have found the staff to be friendly and accommodating and the room to be consistent  the price is reasonable for the location  i will continue to use them every time i travel to nyc  when i go to nyc i always stay at the new yorker because of its location and value  the rooms are always clean and the views amazing  the staff is always attentive to your needs  we will be back in a few weeks  used my wyndham points for two nights and purchased two more nights  notified front desk at checkin and had a seamless transition between to two reservations  keeping the same room  we found our room in excellent condition  standard room was a bit small but not enough to  nice place to stay and close to the madison square gardens and many other fun places to visit  penn station is right across the street and that s very convenient  clean rooms and nice choices for food and drink at the hotel  the staff were all nice and helpful  the location is perfect for shopping and across the street from madison square gardens  our suite was very clean  comfortable and quite spacious  we all enjoyed the lovely lounge and the tic tock for anytime dinning was superb  the staff were super friendly and very  i ll start by saying i found absolutely nothing wrong with my stay  its an older hotel  with great location and a good value  its an older property  things are kept up but you can see the age on them  its clean but weathered  there s nothing fancy about this place  absolute amazing time staying at the new yorker from the easy professional check in from miguel who even upgraded us to   rd floor with a fantastic view of empire state building and madison square garden  staff all friendly and helpful lady in tick tick restaurant advised us  we stayed for   nights at the new yorker  room was super clean  a bit tight for   adults but only in room to sleep so it was fine  had requested high floor with a view and this was given to us  staff very nice  expect the bathroom to be small but has all the necessities    i would not recommend this hotel to anyone  especially when there are so many great choices available for accommodations in nyc  we stayed here for   days and it felt like an eternity  the first room we were placed in was extremely musty and the decor was very dated  i felt as  stayed at the new yorker for my first visit to nyc to see a concert at madison square gardens  great property and really affordable given its location to everything i wanted to do  make sure you check out the museum in the basement  i wandered across it by accident  the  we stayed for   nights and were very pleased with the room  it was simple but clean  as a visit to new york for us meant being out for most of the day this room was more than adequate  the bed was comfy  check in and out went smoothly  the location is perfect  lots within   rd time to the wyndham and it didn t disappoint  great rooms  comfortable bed and good amenities  pool is great although sadly was closed for last   days of our stay and when asked at reception when it would reopen was told it was open despite being coned off  great location   i stayed here for three nights and had to switch rooms everyday i was here  the first night we were assigned a room that had an adjoining door and we didn t know if who was next door  as we were about to go to sleep someone pushed up against the door and our adjoining door  this was our second visit the last being    years ago  how the place has changed  first class with good access to all theme parks and local restaurants well worth the    ticket on the i trolley  drinks are a bit on the dear side but it is a   star rating  staff are friendly and  an overall very pleasant stay for the   weeks our party of   were there  the hotel is excellently located for accessing the theme parks and has lots of great restaurants within a very short walk  rooms were a good size and decent standard  although the bathrooms were a bit  i mixed business and vacation with my stay at the wyndham orlando  i was there for a conference  the hotels rooms were ok if you are not planning to spend too much time in them  the conference portion was pretty good  i was impressed with the food and the meetings rooms were  we stayed for   nights in a suite on   th floor         the views were absolutely amazing  the bedroom windows views were onto the empire state building one way and the financial centre downtown  world trade centre the other way  for   days we loved every sunset and sunrise  the  very small room as expected  i had to hire a small fridge to store my medication  housekeeping very efficient and room was spotless  never tried the in house diner  the best thing about the hotel was the location next to the subway station  my wife cannot walk far so we used the  fantastic boutique hotel very central to macey s times square and penn station  we where there just prior to thanksgiving leaving the morning of thanksgiving  hotel is fantastic and nyc as always a pleasure to visit good price  but beware hidden charges    night stay incites a further      in facility fees  then you have to pay    dollars for your luggage to be looked after   so what s the facility fee for exactly   room are small but clean  the saving grace for me was john at the concierge  we stayed here for    days  i was disappointed at the lack of facilities available for guests  no coffee tea facilities   they wanted     per day for a drip filter     no kettle  no laundry service  it blew out our food budget tremendously as we couldn t prepare anything in  we stayed here for   weeks in october  on arrival we were given the card keys to our rooms in block     firstly the negatives   the corridors to the rooms are awful  dark and like a cheap motel  not a great first impression  the air con units need replacing  very loud and  stayed here this weekend for a family trip to universal  cost      for two nights despite a significantly better deal being booked online   be aware there are several state and resort taxes fees added which will add to price  free parking and wifi  gym onsite and two smallish  this hotel is massive   everything is so close by and convenient  the restaurant  gatorville  is really  really good and inexpensive  rasique  sure i m spelling it wrong was extremely nice  he drove us back and forth in the golf cart from building to building  veronica at the  i was hesitant to book this hotel due to prior experience with wyndham  the only reason i booked this hotel is because a colleague was also staying there  the guestroom was dusty and had a weird odor  there are no grab bars in the tub shower and the tub was slippery causing me  my fiance and i stayed here last december for his   th birthday trip  he s a bit of coaster fanatic so we did a quick weekend trip to orlando so he could visit busch tampa and sea world  we had a great trip and enjoyed the parks  our room at the wyndham orlando on int l drive  this may be close to the parks but dont let that fool you   shuttle service is virtually non existent so be prepared to uber or drive yourself  beds super uncomfortable  i can t stress that enough   so tired  still ants crawling up the wall blood splatters up the wall in the  this hotel says it is remodeled online but it is far from that   the bathrooms are dirty  the tubs are chipped and cracked  crack in the ceiling above the bed dropping plaster into the bed  the carpets are dirty the mattress was disgusting when i looked at it  the outside when  lobby was nicely renovated  but booked a renovated superior king room that was small  bathroom was very small and sliding doors barely worked  parking lots need maintenance  pool area could be updated  etc  i would not book again  while at airport i was able to book this property on my phone  which was one of the last places available  near my daughter condo  it was pet friendly which is good to know when you need to come back with your dog  clean double bed  with small fridge and coffee maker  full tub   party of   on a   week stay oct nov stayed in premium rooms in building    which is a short walk outside from the pool area gatorville reception   after booking we were very concerned at the amount of bad reviews we had read  i emailed the hotel who put our mind at ease  the room smelled musty on entrance and the fridge wasn t working  the fridge was fixed very quickly after notifying the front desk  they have excellent customer service  they just need to update their furniture and do something about the musty smell in the rooms  our family stayed at this beautiful hotel resort  we had lots of fun  it is very close to to the orlando outlet for excelent shopping  we recomend it  great pools  safe location  close to excelent restaurants we had a king bed room that had ample living space  we did encounter a problem with the door lock and the front desk manager was able to get it fixed quickly  the conference rooms were very nice and the food served during the conference breaks was good  this is my second or third time staying here  the grounds here are immaculate  the rooms are awesome  and the staff is the friendliest of any orlando hotel that i stay at  much to my surprise  even though i was only here for one night this trip  they secretly upgraded me to  we frequent orlando and usually stay at castle or reaidence inn  we decided to try wyndham  we arrived late  finding check in wasn t very clear  two employees directed us to the wrong location  one employee pointed to the conference center and it was like a maze to find check  history and efficiency ooze from this place  built in the heyday of deco architecture  the lobby retains elements that remind you of a bygone era  i last stayed here in       when the property was sorely in need of renovation  recent upgrades made by wyndom and other owners  stayed here for   nights week before christmas last year  this was our third time to new york but first time at this hotel  the location is great  we hardly got the subway to anywhere  the only place we got the subway was when we went further afield to natural history museum or  great hotel small rooms but you expect that in new york   great location    mins away from times square   mins away from empire state building and next door is the penn station for the subway  would definitely      recommend this hotel  the photos i put up are from our bedroom just returned from an amazing week in nyc  stayed at the new yorker for its great location and accessibility to everywhere   this is where the hotel scores really highly with penn station right next door and easy access uptown and downtown  hotel itself is iconic with some  this was my third visit to the newyorker and after comparing it with others  even higher end  i will only stay here  great location and the vibe of the busy hotel lobby is fabulous  it has such an old world newyork feel  rooms are small but what else do you expect in nyc but  the hotel isn t horrible but i wouldn t stay here again  it didn t really live up to my expectations of what i thought a wyndham property should be  the room decor is ok but has a dirty feeling  the outside appearance isn t pleasing and the room cleaning is sub par  we had to check out early because the room smelled like sewer and we couldn t take it anymore  this is more like a dirty motel  not a resort  the rooms are very old and it seems that they just don t take care of them  the blinds were dirty and the paint on the bathroom ceiling  we stayed a full week at this hotel recently and some issues came up  we requested an accessible room with a roll in shower  not a tub  but got a tub which wasn t correct but we made due because we wanted to get to our room  maid service in general was always late in the   it was so close to what we were there for            nothing  everything was great it was really clean with comfortable bed and quiet placy           nothing  rooms were quiet and large  beds were adequate   checkin was pleasant    free parking on premises           guess what  a fire alarm went off at   pm  no staff directing or any communications whatsover from beginning to end  no clear assembly point anywhere  and no staff knocking on doors to checking people what left the rooms  actually  aside from the reception staff on the phone  i never saw anyone else directing or assisting guests   after the fire brigade confirmed it was a false alarms and had left the alarm went off again with yet another false alarm  never got a note to explain nor an apology for the disruption on checkout   smelly carpets  old and old  needs a face lift badly   convenient location and excellent hotel for the modest price            i did not like that it is impossible to walk to the train station that is only few hundred meters away  it is not ecological that a shuttle bus needs several miles to reach that station   the location was excellent to td garden  as well as within walking distance to quincy market            it wasn t as clean or updated for the cost of the room  the hallways weren t vacuumed and the carpet in the room didn t seem clean   there is nothing to complain about the location   it s close to boudwin and charles station  the major tour spots on freedom trail are also within walking distance  my favorite part is jogging along charles river in the morning  which made me feel like living in boston  although the breakfast provided was too expensive for us  we made ourselves at home every morning at whole foods  which is just around the corner    there is a      gym at the second floor  the equipment is limited but you can still do some basic training in it            there is no microwave or electric kettle  which is inconvenient  especially for guests from china  who are generally used to drinking hot water      the check in time is another drawback   pm is too late   the location            the pricing  the parking and extra fees  charging for every little thing   the parking for the price you pay and no parking included  only    minutes from td garden             the room had no refrigerator or microwave  ran out of toilet paper and tissues in the middle of the night  cleaning and maintenance people just knocked then walked right in  didn t matter if you were changing or showering  then woke up to cockroaches in the room  worst         i ve ever spent   comfy beds  big rooms  friendly service            no breakfast supplied  no came too clean roon and no check bedroom  no refridgeretor and microwave  location           the parking fees were insanely high     i ended up paying     for parking there for    hours     that s not right  quiet rooms   very friendly staff   staff solved our issue quickly           bathroom pipes were broken in the first room we got   for the price of stay  definitely not worthy it   also it s around hospitals  so expect   usd to park  quiet environment  nice place to stay if you are very tired from long travel           filty carpet  noisy aircon i have to on a noisier fan as the cold air from the ventilation does not circulate well inside the room   the wyndham grand is in the best location in clearwater beach  the hotel is very attractive and well maintained  the staff was highly accommodating and the one problem we did have  was taken care of with a minimum of difficulty  the front desk staff could not have been better             i have no complaints   location was perfect for td garden event  staff was friendly and courteous            booked a room with   beds and only got one with a roll away  not too comfortable     toilet was backed up and had to call for help late at night  problem was resolved promptly   the location was great           i didn t like that there wasn t a continental breakfast  for the value of the room  the hotel needs breakfast   i understand that there is a restuarant and a cafe  if that s the case  then a meal credit should he given to the customers   thank you everything was good  this hotel needs a upgrade   feel cleaning  location  car service  access to restaurants  shops           nothing really  it was a good experience  staff were nice           hotel was quite shabby  it needs a makeover  we had to ask to move into a better room twice  eventually was given a junior sweet which wasnt too bad  all rooms have a big gap at the bottom of the door   nothing           aircon was half broken and too noisy to be on while sleeping  cleanliness of the sheets dubious  everything old and musty  forgot my kindle in the sheets    i called several times  left voicemails  sent emails  never got a reply   avoid this place at all costs   the hotel was in a good location and the staff were accommodating  the room was nice  though small  and clean            the pool was really cold  almost too cold to go in  we had our room upgraded from a regular to executive and it was tiny  myself and a friend thought it would be bigger   good location  boston is smaller than i thought  could walk anywhere  comfortable place  clean            no concierge  desk staff did not have good input or where to go or where to eat   bed was nice comfortable   lot quieter than expected  friendly staff            no hot tub   great location within easy walk of downtown  whole foods out the back door  perfect if you need access to mgh           rundown  not a good restaurant  area not exciting at all  nothing much just ordinary hotel           the double queen was very small  the room was dirty  the whole hotel was not decently clean  i liked the location and shuttle service to the airport           the phone in our room didn t work  the air conditioner leaked a lot of water on the floor  i ate in the restaurant downstairs and found a hair in my food    room was an extremely long way from a very  very slow elevator   the place and the staff is very nice            the price of the bedroom for one night is very expensive   just terrible  they didn t have a lifeguard for the pool so it was closed for several hours until they found one  pool is in poor condition certainly not like their photos  hotel old  room had mildew smell too many better cooler hipper hotels in boston  very disappointed with this place           see above  location            bar   drinks were far to expensive  the quietness            room too small  no hot water   the room itself was clean and put together           the wifi connection was consistently very bad and unusable  the water in the bathroom was never hot  only lukewarm at the hottest setting both at night and in the morning   i m always great here  good location near red line and walking distance to all sites  large comfortable rooms            ambulance can by noisy as the hotel is near the hospital  pool is a little basic and doesn t open until      am   as we headed closer to property we noticed the price go down considerably on booking com   we had some struggles resolving the manner  kipp added in that help  he also gave us a beautiful room with a nice view as it was our    year anniversary   august         thank you kipp  everything was old  location            hallway and property maintenance  example garden water was leaking all day and night in the front of property and enterance to restaurants and car park  near airport  free shuttle bus  free wifi  good price            air conditioner is noisy   free shuttle service is good  it was hot in hallways and elevators  the hotel entrance dirty and has a stale smell            the environment could do with upgrade and repairs  i enjoyed my lunch downstairs at the cafe             pillows were small  and too soft   pretty standard hotel  comfortable beds and spacious room            bathroom was a little small  at check in  staff seemed a little overwhelmed and stressed out  gym was tiny and overheated  common space in the lobby can get a little crowded  a little overpriced  but so are pretty much all hotels in boston   the property is       min away from multiple locations such as boston common  downtown crossing  quincy market  and is also   mins away from the train station  there s also a convenient store and a wholefoods market at the back with easy access    we were very comfortable with everything else in the hotel   the place           nothing  clean   friendly staff   and very accommodating           pool area needs to be tidy up at the end of the day   room should ve been a bit bigger  the mattresses are really old  could feel the springs   good location and large room    good dining facilities in the hotel also food that you had a cvs store and while leg foods so close           toilet paper dispenser should not be behind the toilet as it is too hard to reach   the room was perfect  great view of the mountains  the entire staff was great            the mandatory valet parking   the bed was very good for sleep and clean  love it   close to the airport           there was not water for room coffe  everything  everything else was great  staff was helpful  food and drinks good with a reasonable price  if you re looking for           the hot tub was takrn over by little children jumping in and out with swimmies on with no adult supervision   friendly staff  great location   outdoor pool and loungers were great           room wasn t ready at time they told us to come back for  but received complimentary breakfast for   the following morning   feces in pool  couldn t use pool  main reason we booked there   i stayed because my flight was cancelled till morning and i needed a place near the airport   so i found one with a nice pool i could swim in   cafe in lobby is    hours  hurray  i was to take the shuttle at        free airport shuttle every half hour   a convenience store  cafe  bar  and restaurant            i was in a room with an adjoining door to the next room  the door was paper thin and there were loud men in the next room who talked very loudly late at night  they also had their phone on the bedside table right on the other side of the door  and it beeped all night  paper thin door   ask for one without and adjoining door   also i think my washroom was right under the hvac on the roof  so it was very loud and shaking  luckily that sound didn t carry out of the bathroom though  new york is an expensive place to visit  if your flight is via newark  consider basing yourself at this clean and comfortable hotel  for me it provided good value for money  and the free    hour shuttle to   from the airport allowed easy access to nj transit services to nyc            there are no walking routes to the airport or to any train station  that s no fault of the hotel  just a downside of being located in such a car based city   the carpets were really dirty  as were the walls and ceilings  the ceiling tiles were all loose and because there was a storm they were flapping in the wind all night  we arrived and there were no towels in the bathroom  i imagine this place was nice about    years ago  but it really needs a renovation  if i paid     i d understand  but the night we stayed the rate was        very good location    helpful staff members   food and service were excellent            should have been free for the room price  front staff did not indicate it was not included with price of room   location  service  pool  staff  great rooms  great service  great value   everything            nothing   thought alcohol  beer prices way over the top considering tip     a beer really     then option should be for vallet parking     plus tip per day  it s location           air conditioning and in room ventilation      mins walk to most attractions            next to hospital  the room is dated   good location           staff were just alright  rooms seemed dated  friendly staff  comfortable room and great swimming pool  i didn t like the room you give us to    floor when we arrived  in the resa  we said that we want a room on the first or second floor because one person didn t take the elevator   the staff is friendly and helpful  the facility is worn out  very cramped bathroom  beat up furniture in room  broken coffee maker and hairdryer  it was clean  excellent location for people with business at mass general or for sightseeing  we cut off a few nights at the end of our stay within the grace period  to make changes  however our room rate went up considerably and we did not realize it  be sure to check your receipt if you make any changes to your reservation   everything from top to bottom was great  the location is good  room is decent  check in was easy and fast  staff was ok             thankfully the windows could open cause the air quality was bad  probably from old carpets  very slow elevator  price was too much for the quality  it s hard to get to  unless you are familiar with newark international airport and it s confusing highway system   housekeeping staff           restaurant com  the property was relatively clean  a little outdated  we never had a problem with the shower water was always warm  the location was very good  we walked everywhere  averaging about    miles per day  the cost was significantly cheaper than all other hotels in then vicinity  which was our main reason for choosing it             the beds were awful  very uncomfortable  we woke up with back pain everyday  the rooms do not come with a refrigerator  i even requested one stating i d pay extra  and i still didn t get one  the pool is cold  not heated  even on hot days it was uncomfortably cold  the bar is insanely expensive      for a mixed drink  and it was terrible  go somewhere else   the front desk receptionist  bariah  was informative  helpful  polite and made our overall stay at wyndham gardens enjoyable  it was a joy to see that the pool and the pool area was thoroughly cleaned every morning  our room was comfortable and clean  the staff was friendly            at the restaurant that is attached to the hotel  the starlight  the waitress  whom we later found out to be one of the managers there  attached on a service charge to our breakfast bill  the previous day we had also had breakfast there and there was no service charge  although as we customarily do  we left a tip  when we asked her what the service charge was for  she said   if you dine in  you receive a service charge  but if you order out you don t receive a service charge  this service charge was not added on to any of our other receipts that we attained when dining there during our stay  we ate at the restaurant four times and did not receive a service charge until this day  also  with my breakfast i had forgotten to ask for wheat bread instead of white bread  when i asked her for the wheat bread  after receiving an eye roll from her  she brought me what requested  although i don t mind being charged the tip in advance  i felt that this practice should have been consistent so that it is understood that only some select visitors are tagged with a service charge being that we dined in and did not order out  we should not have been charged a service charge   we loved the location of the hotel            we were dissatisfied with the property and the room for the price we paid  i expected much more and would recommend renovating   location  pool and friendly staff           the beds were very uncomfortable   way too hard      breakfast buffet was too expensive  the bathtub was also not clean unfortunately  staff was pleasant  friendly and helpful           restaurant prices are way too high especially with children   great location clean room and great shower            nothing  the food was okay but very expensive            i paid for a non smoking room and the room smell like cigarettes   no cover  sheets for the pull out couch  the shower and tub was dirty with hair in it   the lobby was beautiful  the pillows on the bed was plentiful and comfortable  i was glad there was an iron and ironboard in the room  i was glad to have a desk in the room  the furniture was nice  plenty of parking             the room smelled bad when i walked in  had to spray the room down  the ac was very loud  there was no remote in the room for the tv but they sent one up when called  the bathroom wasn t clean enough  the sink was cracked  the towel rack was barely hanging on the makeshift drywall that needed replacement  some of the titles in the ceiling in the bathroom shower area needed cleaning  there was only one wash cloth in the room  the headboard wasn t secure to the wall  the bed was very uncomfortable   the kitchen included new pots and pans  sharp knives  nice appliances  we loved the linens  the access to washers and dryers  the staff was just wonderful always eager to help us and make our stay the best  very nice game room  fresh apples and cookies are available for the guests to enjoy            i really do not like  as a guest already paying the hotel fees  having to pay the additional     a day to park  for the entire hotel  there was only one bbq  a very good one  but still just the one   the air conditioner stopped working our last night and maintenance was not able to fix it  easy airport transfer            very outdated  difficult location unless you truly are just looking for an overnight airport stay   not much            the property is in very bad condition  is dirty  unclean and in general terms the management is not paying attention  regardless of the price  please go somewhere else  we left after   hrs   there is so much good to say about this property it would take a short book  from the valet to the valet  basically the entire stay  the service was impeccable  but i would be remiss if i did not single out the outstanding service from the desk clerk who checked us in  the property itself is gorgeous and spotless and we will be returning  thank you so much            n a  location is awesome  we were able to watch the  th of july fireworks from our hotel room  what a show    we were able to walk around downtown and stop by the hotel if needed            parking your car is expensive  however  it is boston  great walking city   cost           older in need of updates  shower was not goo  very good emplacement to visit boston           no fridge in the room in july   i was traveling with friends and was able to get a room across the hall from them           everything was good   clean  comfortable  good location  free airport shuttle             old fashion look  breakfast not included in the price  no coffee desk at the lobby   everything  the hotel is in the middle of nowhere but handy to the airport           i forgot my swimmers  the bed  pool was dirty  location            the coffee maker in my room was very dirty   the design of the suites was amazing  the staff was courteous  huge shout out to evan  he did a top notch job  ralph was very kind at check in as well  the suites were just gorgeous   the facilities were well thought out  if ever i am back in colorado  then this hotel will be my first choice             the valet parking   it is a beautiful hotel in a great location            i wasn t a fan of the coffee  maybe provide a flavored creamer   the convenient store in the lobby  the parking  the housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful            mold in the shower and on the shower curtain  locked out of the room twice  key card did not work  i would have benefited from a refrigerator and microwave in the room  no free breakfast  available for tour groups only   proximity to airport only           very unkempt and unpleasant smell  that place needs a serious renovation  will never stay there again till things change   the service was great  surpassed expectations  felt so welcomed and appreciated as a guest            that i only has two days     location was great  pool was ok  staff was friendly            could hear elevators all nite from our room   the room was spacious and comfortable  we enjoyed our stay  will definitely visit again   locarion           hotel seemed expensive for what it offered   the bathrooms by the front lobby where really disgusting  there where no coffee or tea options in the lobby for people to have access to  it really seemed this hotel is all about making money  the room however was clean and the housekeeping staff where very nice    the staff at the front lobby besides one older woman  where very rude  they wanted to charge us    a piece for seltzer water which was ridiculous just for water  we did love the pool and location  otherwise the other things could really improve on customer service   location           dirty and old  the restaurant            not much options if restaurant outside  the restaurant is a little bit expensive  staff  cleanliness  price  very tough front desk meeting us at night            no refrigerator available or even microwave  spacious modern hotel  well located  walking distance to the tourist highlights   price for parking  staff food pool and the location of the holtel is great close to nyny hoboken airport u can be in any of these places in    min or less              could use an update on the furniture and bathroom in the room needs a little work  close to the airport  shuttle between the airport and the hotel every    min   h           the ac was broken  bed is not very comfortable  no microwave  it was in a great location             our key never worked at our room  and it seemed overpriced  also i was over charged and no one could seem to explain why that took place   the staff was responsive  friendly and very helpful  the accommodations were lovely and incredibly clean            paying daily for the valet parking in addition to the room costs   good location  friendly staff and good service  also close to vail and the entire valley   close proximity to the airport  friendly staff           almost everything   the room smelt  it was damp  puddle of water leaking from the aircon   dirty  squished bugs on walls   no working aircon  airport transfer was really late collecting us from the airport  after an already delayed and cancelled flight  food from restaurant wasn t great  wouldn t even give this a   star  and wasn t cheap either   location of hotel to everything clearwayer had to offer could not be better            digital thermostat light was very bright and lit up room at night making sleeping challenging  thermostat could be in a better location  small pool for a resort of this caliber   friendly staff  nice bar            bathtub had no safety mats  when stepping in the tub  it was slippery   the breakfast buffet was too expensive   excellent location  close to t stop  coffee shops             our rooms were next to the elevator and it was noisy  had a hard time sleeping   proximity to the aiport             very little food options   old infrastructure  no response to the pre check in messages sent  all the extra soft fluffy pillows            a very large area of the carpet from the window to the desk was soaking wet  not as if someone spilled something but like a large leak somewhere should be checked out   it was first class but at      a night i expected a little more  location was good and as centrally as advertised            windows don t open  air conditioning loud unable to set a good temperature  carpets in room old tatty and dirty sorry  this certainly wasn t    hotel and not worth about     per night  no mini bar  fridge in room   the breakfast at the hotel was good and the service and price were also good and the coffee at the lobby cafe was also very good           my son brought a salad from the cafe in the loby and it was not any good   but when he tool it back down there they did give him his money back with no problems  close to the airport           dirty bathroom floor and wall tiles broken grouting missing  the staff was helpful and amazing            the

not locked  shower was broken  it was way too expensive for this quality            very good location and clean  overall not much stuff there and we were expecting more   good location           better communication between staff  rooms were elegant and beautiful  incredibly comfortable beds  the hot tub was amazing           n a  clean  gorgeous and very accommodating           everything was perfect  nothing to complain about and expectations were exceeded  there is a big roach in the lobby and fresh spit on the elevator door and the elevator was filthy  i was afraid to walk on the rugs in the room everything smelled like must  the place is old and unkempt and worn out  the hallways were not clearn   bellman anthony was so kind and welcoming to all of us  my   yr old son really thought he was nice            the pool umbrellas could have been bolted to the base to prevent flying off during wind gusts  my son almost got hit by a flying umbrella  scared me  location was

bumper   great location  location to mgh           we were not told that a     incidental charge would be put on our credit card and not refunded for      business days   didn t like that i was booked into a wheelchair accessible room and when mentioned it to front desk they never offered to accommodate me with another room  don t you request these rooms  there must have been a shortage of wash cloths and hand towels  especially my last night i had to use wash cloths i picked up at walmart   thought i was in jamaica when every morning i had to wait for the hot water in shower at least    minutes before it got hot   good location           the bed was old and i woke up each morning with a sore back  that shouldn t happen for over      a night   location and very clean  room service for coffee cups and cleaning the room  was fair  front desk staff not friendly  needs brightening up  this hotel has family size rooms             the hotel is next to a hospital which means you can frequently hear the sound of ambulances   location           the cleaning crew forgot their used clearing gear twice in the bathroom   restaurant was ok  reasonably priced           the air conditioner in rm            was too noisy  needs to be fixed   this property had everything  convenience store  restaurant  concession  shuttle to the airport  pool  etc  all the stores were open at

and convenience store open   h           my room was not very clean  felt dirty  tired furnishings and bedding   room was clean and bed was comfortable           front desk service was terrible  the people working at the front desk are the face of your hotel  they should be happy and helpful  great location within walking distance to boston commons and freedom trail sights  the hotel itself is

desk wasn t very nice  the pool was cold   the one bedroom is a spacious unit with a full kitchen and luxurious bathroom  the concierge  michael  went above and beyond             the hotel should

old lady working at the receptionist desk  she was quite rude  at times shouting at the guests  she should retire forthwith   the staff were all so friendly  frank  the chef at the buffet bar was over the top in meeting our needs    of us eat gluten free  after the first day of ordering a more specialized array of foods  he would see us the following mornings and have the gluten free items cooking before we got to the counter to order  he even surprised us with special foods as well  it absolutely made the entire stay better than we could have imagined            it would have been nice if the towel counter st the pool was open the whole time  it rained on and off alot during our stay  so we spent all of our time at the beach  there were a few times we were unable to acquire towels for the beach   the internet barely worked or didn t work  the location was great            the bed was the most uncomfortable bed i have ever been in   we were early for check in and the staff was very
